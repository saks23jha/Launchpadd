{"text": "Dear Shareholders, Customers and Friends, We are continuing to navigate through the lingering challenges of the pandemic and respond to changing market conditions, driven by the steep and rapid rise in interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) responded to sharply elevated price inflation, brought on by supply chain constraints and international unrest, including the war in Ukraine, by increasing the target federal funds range a total of 425 basis points in seven tightening actions in 2022. The unprecedented pace of the rate increases has lowered asset values and has begun to put pressure on bank net interest margins, as increases in funding costs are beginning to surpass earning asset yields. Strong 2022 financial performance. Although 2022 presented challenges, FNCB posted a strong earnings performance as we remained focused on executing strategic initiatives designed to advance financial performance and create efficiencies over the long-term, while delivering exceptional service and support to the customers and communities we serve. We reported net income for 2022 of $20.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted common share compared to net income of $21.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share, in 2021. The $1.0 million, or 4.4% decrease primarily reflected increases in non- interest expense and the provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Return on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity equaled 1.21% and 15.55%, respectively in 2022, compared to 1.36% and 13.46%, respectively in 2021. We experienced a $5.3 million, or 10.5%, increase in tax-equivalent net interest income to $55.2 million in 2022 from $49.9 million in 2021, as a greater amount of tax-equivalent interest income was partially reduced by an increase in interest expense.

Strong earning asset growth and an increase in the yield on earning assets contributed to a $9.3 million, or 17.6%, increase in tax-equivalent interest income to $61.9 million in 2022 from $52.6 million in 2021. Average earning assets increased $183.5 million, or 12.7%, to $1.633 billion in 2022 compared to $1.449 billion in 2021. Specifically, average loans and leases increased $123.9 million, or 13.0%, to $1.074 billion in 2022 from $950.5 million in 2021, which reflected new lending product offerings, strong organic loan demand and the purchase of third-party originated loans and loan pools. Also contributing to the increase in average earning assets was a $120.4 million, or 28.0%, increase in average investment securities to $550.0 million in 2022, compared to $429.6 million in 2021. Partially offsetting the higher amount of tax-equivalent interest income was a $4.0 million, or 148.9%, increase in interest expense to $6.7 million in 2022 from $2.7 million in 2021. Greater reliance on wholesale funding and increases in deposit costs due to higher deposit rates and increased competition for deposits in our market area contributed to the increase in interest expense. Like the banking industry in general, FNCB was more reliant on wholesale funding in 2022, which resulted in the $97.3 million increase in average borrowed funds to $109.5 million in 2022 compared to just $12.2 million in 2021.

For the first half of 2022, management was successful in stalling deposit rate increases, however in the latter half of 2022, additional rate increases, and heightened competition caused us to respond with increases in deposit rates, which was the primary factor leading to a 30-basis point increase in the cost of funds to 0.55% in 2022 from 0.25% in 2021. The tax-equivalent net interest margin compressed seven basis points to 3.38% in 2022 from 3.45% in 2021. FNCB recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $2.0 million in 2022, compared to $166 thousand in 2021, which primarily reflected higher loan and lease volumes. Non-interest income decreased $287 thousand, or 3.5%, to $8.0 million compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The year over year decrease in non-interest income resulted primarily from an unfavorable change in market value of equity securities and net loss on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities, coupled with reductions in net gains on the sale of mortgages held for sale, and loan related fees. Non-interest expense totaled $35.5 million in 2022, an increase of $4.4 million, or 14.2%, from $31.1 million in 2021, which primarily reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, data processing, regulatory assessments, and other operating expenses. These increases were reflected in the increase in the Bank’s efficiency ratio to 55.06% in 2022, compared to 53.63% in 2021.

The strong balance sheet growth reflected substantial increases in loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, of $143.1 million, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion at December 31, 2022, from $967.0 million at December 31, 2021. While, available-for-sale debt securities decreased $46.5 million, or 8.9%, to $476.1 million, from $522.6 million at December 31, 2021, caused largely by a decline in the fair value of these securities due to rising interest rates. Total deposits decreased $34.8 million, or 2.4%, to $1.421 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.455 billion at December 31, 2021, which reflected the return of municipal deposit seasonality and the outflow of excess COVID-19 deposits.

FNCB’s strong asset quality reflects continued discipline in our lending practices and our proactive attention with respect to credit management. We recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $2.0 million in 2022, compared to $166 thousand in 2021, which primarily reflected the increase in loan and lease volumes.

{"text": "6 reviews FNCB’s deposit mix and deposit pricing as part of its asset/liability management, taking into consideration rates offered by competitors in its market area and balance sheet interest-rate sensitivity. Competition The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. FNCB faces direct competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, as well as other financial and non-financial institutions outside of its market area through online loan and deposit product offerings. Competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, internet-based financial technology (“FinTech”) companies and, with respect to deposits, institutions offering investment a lternatives, including money market funds and online deposit accounts. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines, as well as from economic conditions. The cost of regulatory compliance remain s high for community banks as compared to their larger competitors that are able to achieve economies of scale. As a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of the Bank’s competitors and their respective affiliates are larger and may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, a wider array of services, or more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. FNCB considers its major competitors to be local commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in its market area. Competitors may offer deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than FNCB has been able to offer.

The growth and profitab ility of FNCB depends on its continued ability to successfully compete. Management believes interest rates on deposits, especially money market and time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged on loans within FNCB’s market area to be very competitive. Supervision and Regulation FNCB and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a variety of statutes, regulations, and policies, as well as ongoing regulatory supervision and review. Federal statutes that apply to FNCB and the Bank include the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the USA Pa triot Act, the Federal Reserv e Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Bank is subject primarily to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and, as a state-chartered financial institution, to the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965. In general, these statutes, regulations promulgated in accordance with these statutes, and interpretations of the statutes and regulations by the banking regulatory agencies establish the eligible business activities of FNCB and the Bank, certain acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on intercompany transactions, such as loans and dividends, and capital adequacy requirements, among other things.

FNCB is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information that they may require. BHCA and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcemen t actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. The BHCA requires approval of the FRB for, among other things, the acquisition of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting securities or subs tantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or before the merger or consolidation with another bank holding company. With certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries.

Capital Adequacy Requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted risk-b ased capital adequacy and leverage capital adequacy requirements pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applicati ons. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. Financial institutions are subject to extensive and detailed capital requirements, which generally follow a framework of rules adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III calls for the following capital requirements: ● A minimum ratio of common equit y tier I (“CET I”) capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. ● A minimum ratio of tier I capital to ris k-weighted assets of 6%. ● A minimum ratio of total capital to ris k-weighted assets of 8%. ● A minimum levera ge ratio of 4%. Basel III provides for a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2. 5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements for each of the CET I, tier I capital, and total capital ratios. The buffer must consist entirely of CET I capital. As a result, if a banking organization does not have a CET I, Tier I capital, and total capital ratios of at least 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, its ability to make or commit to discretionary dividends and discretionary bonus payments to \"executive officers\" or engage in share repurchases or redemptions genera lly will be restricted in accordance w ith a pre-determined \"maximum payout ratio.\" Under the maximum payout ratio formula, a banking organization with a capital conservation", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 16, "chunk_id": 41}}

Basel III provides for new deductions from and adjustments to C ET I. These include, for example, under current rules, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax a ssets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET I to the extent that any one such category exceeds 25.00% of CET I. Basel III also imposed changes to methodologies for determining risk weighted assets, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, such as a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors, the ris k weighting of equity exposures and past due loans, and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components. During 2018, the FRB raised the threshold of its \"Small Ba nk Holding Company\" exemption to the application of consolidated capital requirements for qualifying small bank holding companies from $1 billion to $3 billion of consolidated assets. Consequently, qualifying bank holding companies having less than $3 billion of consolidated assets are not subject to the consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise directed by the FRB.

As of December 31, 2022, FNCB qualifies as a small bank holding company and is therefore not subject to the consolidated capital requirements. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018, federal banking agencies adopted the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework available to depository institutions having less than $10 billion in total assets and meeting certain othe r qualifying criteria. The CBLR ru les provide that qualifying community banking organizations that adopt the CBLR framew ork and that maintain a CBL R in excess of 9% will be considered to have met the generally applicable leverage an d risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ capital rules and the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized.” FNCB has not elected to use the CBLR framework at this time. Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\"FDIA\"), each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for an insured institution which it regulates.

The Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violati ons of law, regulations or written orders of a governmental agency. In addition, regulators are provided with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance and cease-and-desist orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirma tive action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss.

The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prev ent unfair, deceptive or abusiv e practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including, in certain circumstances, a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows ce rtain borrowers to raise cert ain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB.

To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the Bank in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the Bank. To the extent that loans are secured by real estate, adverse conditions in the real estate market may reduce the ability of the borrowers to generate the necessary cash flow for repayment of the loan and reduce the ability to collect the full amount of the loan upon a default.

FNCB is subject to credit risk, and FNCB's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions and other factors that adversely affect FNCB's borrowers. FNCB’s business depends on its ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, FNCB is exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover FNCB’s outstanding exposure . In addition, FNCB is exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the United States generally, or in the market areas in which FNCB oper ates specifically, experiences material disruption, FNCB’s borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral FNCB holds may decrease in value or become illiquid, and FNCB’s level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan and lease losses.", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 20, "chunk_id": 55}}

Many of FNCB’s loans are made to small businesses and middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital and borrowing capacity than larger entities and may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions and be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures. Changes in general economic conditions in the ma rket area in which FNCB operates mat negatively impact this important customer sector. Additionally, FNCB may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to pay their loan obligations as a result of personal circumstances, such as divorce, unemployment or death. Consequently, FNCB's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with FNCB’s loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that FNCB significantly increase its allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect FNCB’s net income and profitability.

All non-performing loans tota led $2.8 million, or 0.25% of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2022, and $3.9 million, or 0.39%, of total gross loans at Decembe r 31, 2021. Specifically, commercial real estate loans that were non-performing to taled $1.5 million, or 0.14%, of total gr oss loans at December 31, 2022 and $2.5 million, or 0.25%, of total gross loans at December 31, 2021. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on FNCB’s results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of FNCB’s loans are secured by real estate in the Northeastern Pennsylvania market, and substantially all of its loans are to borrowers in that area. FNCB also has a significant amount of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, land acquisition and development lo ans and land-related loans for residential and commercial developments.

At December 31, 2022, $693.8 million, or 61.8 %, of gross loans were secu red by real estate, primarily commercial real estate, in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Management has taken steps to mitigate commercial real estate concentration risk by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and mark et analysis. Of total gross loans, $66.6 million, or 5.9%, were construction, land acquisition and development loans. Co nstruction, land acquisition and development loans have the highest risk of not being collected. An additional $272.0 million, or 24.2%, of portfolio loans were commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate. Historically, commercial and industrial loans generally have had a higher risk of default than other categories of loans, such as single-family residential mortgage loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business and are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. While management believes that the loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations expose FNCB to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in its market area, could adversely affect the quality and collectability of its loans and could increase the level of non-performing loans.

The appraisals and other valuation techniques FNCB uses in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property and other real estate owned may not accurately reflect the net value of the asset. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, FNCB generally requires an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the pr operty at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately reflect the net value of the collateral after the loan is made. As a result, FNCB may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness wh en FNCB forecloses on and se lls the relevant property.

If any of these valuations are inaccurate, FNCB’s financial statements may no t reflect the correct value of FNCB’s OREO, if any, and FNCB’s allowance for loan and lease losses may not reflect accu rate loan impairments. Inaccurate valuation of OREO or inaccurate provisioning for loan and lease losses could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of operations. FNCB’s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if the ALLL is not sufficient to absorb actual losses or if increases to the ALLL were required. The lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations, and that the collateral securing the payment of their obligations may be insufficient to assure repayment. FNCB may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of FNCB’s loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans, which it uses as a basis to estimate and establish its reserves for losses.

At December 31, 2022, the ALLL totaled $14.2 million, representing 1.26% of loans, net of unearned income and net deferred loan origination fees. Although management believes FNCB’s underwriting standards are adequate to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of its loan portfolio due to the ongoing economic environment and the state of the real estate market. The assessment of future performance of the loan portfolio is inherently uncertain. FNCB can give no assurance that non-performing loans will not increase or that non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect its future performance. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the ALLL and may require increases to the ALLL or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in ALLL or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s results of operations and financial condition.

FNCB’s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating FNCB's risks or losses. FNCB’s risk management framework is comprised of various pro cesses, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which FNCB is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. FNCB’s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. FNCB’s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to FNCB. If FNCB’s risk management framework is not effective, FNCB could suffer unexpected losses and its business, financial condition, results of operati ons or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. FNCB may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. FNCB is subject to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could reduce income, cash flows and asset values, which could adversely affect its profitability. FNCB’s earnings and cash flows, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond FNCB’s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve.

Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest FNCB receives on loans an d securities and the interest FNCB pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could affect FNCB’s ability to originate loans and obta in deposits, the fair value of FNCB’s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of FNCB’s assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, FNCB’s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be ad versely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of operations. FNCB uses simulation analysis to model net interest income for various interest rate scenarios over a five-year time horizon. Based on the simulation analysis, FNCB’s interest sensitivity profile at December 31, 2022 was characterized by maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities that were liability sensitive over the next 18 to 24 months, moving to an asset sensitivity position in subsequent years of the model. These simulations are based on numerous assumptions, including but not limited to: the nature and timing of interest rate levels, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows, customer behavior in a rising rate environment and other factors.

When short-term interest rates rise, the rate of interest FNCB pays on its interest-bearing liabilities may rise more quickly than the rate of interest that FNCB receives on its interest-earning assets, which may cause FNCB’s net interest income to decrease. Additionally, a shrinking yield premium, or negative spread, between short-term and long-term market interest rates, a pattern usually indicative of investors' waning expectations of future gr owth and inflation, commonly re ferred to as a flattening of the yield curve, or inversion of the yield curve, typically reduces FNCB’s profit margin as FNCB borrows at shorter terms than the terms at which FNCB lends and invests. In addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on FNCB’s results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also reduce collateral values and necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainty relating to the expected ph ase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect FNCB.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, back ed by Treasury securities, as its prefer red alternative rate for LIBOR however, other market alternatives have been developed. While SOFR has been adopted in select product areas it has not achieved full implementation as an alternative reference rate. At this ti me, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to alternative reference rates as markets continue to transition away from LIBOR. Furthermore, because of the complexity of the transition from LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements. FNCB has significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.

Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on FNCB's business, financial condition and results of operations. FNCB may not be able to successfully compete with others for business. FNCB competes for loans, deposits and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks and other community banking institutions, online divisions of banks located in other markets as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unio ns, mortgage brokers, private lenders and Fintech companies. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of its market area. As noted above, FNCB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulations and supervision, including, in many cases, regulations that limit the type and scope of activities. Many competitors have substantially greater resources and may offer certain services that FNCB and the Bank does not provide, an d operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The differences in available resources and applicable regulations may make it harder for FNCB to compete profitably, reduce the rates that it can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates it must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect its overall financial condition and earnings.

FNCB could be subject credit risk related to derivative obligations. FNCB has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if FNCB defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then it could also be declared in its derivative obligations. FNCB has agreements with certain of its derivatives counterparties that contain a provision where if it fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then it could be required to post additional collateral. FNCB has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties for derivatives in a net liability position.

FNCB may not be able to retain or grow its core deposit base, which could adversely impact its funding costs. Like many financial institutions, FNCB relies on customer deposits as its primary source of funding for its lending activities, and FNCB co ntinues to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base.

Any loss by FNCB of its deposit base could limit its lending ability resulting in lower loan originations, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of operations. FNCB is a bank holding company and depends on dividends from its subsidiary, FNCB Bank, to operate. FNCB is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of FNCB’s operations and FNCB depends upon dividends from the Bank to service its debt, pay its expenses, to repurchase shares of FNCB stock and to pay dividends to FNCB's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank’s regulators could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to FNCB by the Bank. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends and would be unable to repurchase its shares, FNCB in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends to its shareholders.

FNCB has been and may continue to be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation matters arising out of its business. An increased number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits and other consumer driven litigation, have been filed and will likely continue to be filed against financial in stitutions, which may involve substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages. Management believes the risk of litigation generally increases during downturns in the national and local economies. FNCB’s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation and may cause it to incur significant expense.

FNCB cannot be certain that any expansion activity, through de novo branching, acquisition of branches of another financial institution or a whole institution, or the establishm ent or acquisition of nonbanking financial service companies, will prove profitable or will in crease shareholder value. The success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on FNCB’s ability to realize the estimated cost savings and revenue enhan cements from combining its business and that of the target company. FNCB’s ability to realize increases in revenue will depend, in part, on its ability to retain customers and employees, and to capitalize on existing relationships for the provision of additional products and services. If FNCB estimates turn out to be incorrect or FNCB is not able to successfully combine companies, the anticipated cost savings and increased revenues may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

The banking industry is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. The extensive regulatory framework is primarily intended to pr otect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not shareholders. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and, in some instances, may put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, leasing companies and internet-based Fintech companies. FNCB’s regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank’s allowance for loan losses, among other matters. If they deem FNCB to be operating in a manner inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, these regulatory authorities can require the entry into info rmal and formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memorandum of understanding, settlement agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which FNCB would be required to implement identif ied corrective actions to address cited concerns and/or to refrain from taking certain actions in the form of injunctive relief.

In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including state laws and regulations, prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions . The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions.

{"text": "22 One example of updated guidance regarding legislation is that on October 26, 2022, the CFPB issued supervisory guidance which warned financial institutions that levying overdraft fees to consumers who would not reasonably anticipate the fees may constitute an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (\"CFPA\"). In addition, the CFPB issued a compliance bulletin warning that certain de positor fees may similarly violate the CFPA. This guidance comes as a next step in the CFPB’s “junk fee” initiative, launched in January 2022, through which the CFPB has endeavored to identify and take certain steps to curb potentially exploitative fees charged by banks and other financial institutions. While management does not believe that FNCB's ove rdraft fees are in violation of the CFPA, many larger financial institutions have eliminated overdraft charges on consumer accounts and the banking industry has recently announced a significant decrease in overdraft fee income in 2022. Competition from large banks and the imposition of restrictions on overdraft fees by the federal government, may result in FNCB having to change its overdraft fee structure, which could negatively impact future non-interest income run rates.

FNCB is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Because FNCB’s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, FNCB cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Such offerings will likely be dilutive to common shareholders from ownership, earnings and book value perspectives. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, its then current common shareholders. Additionally, if FNCB raises additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, upon liquidation, holders of its debt securities and shares of preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, will receive di stributions of available assets prior to the holders of common stock.

Investment in FNCB’s common stock is also subject to the mark et forces that affect the price of comm on stock in any company. As a result, shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in FNCB’s common stock. Shareholders may not receive dividends on FNCB’s common stock or have their shares repurchased by FNCB. Although FNCB has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, and adopted a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of its common stock, FNCB is not required to do so and may reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends, or repurchase shares, in the future. If FNCB reduces or ceases to pay common stock dividends, or terminates its stock repurchase program, the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected. The principal source of funds from which FNCB pays cash dividends, and repurchase shares, are the dividends received from the Bank.

If FNCB fails to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of its common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in its common stock. In addition, in the event the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to FNCB, FNCB may not be able to service its debt or pay its other obligations, pay dividends on, or repurchase shares of, its common stock and preferred stock.

As a consequence, FNCB would have to disclose in periodic reports it files with the SEC any material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that FNCB’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and would preclude its independent auditors from expressing an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, disclosures of deficiencies of this type in FNCB’s SEC reports could cause investors to lose confidence in its financial reporting and may negatively affect the market price of its common stock and could result in the delisting of its securities from the securities exchanges on which they trade.

Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under the CECL model, banks will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about pa st events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the coll ectability of the reported amount . This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balan ce sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significant ly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of th e CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses, and could require us to signifi cantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the allowance for loan losse s. If we are required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

FNCB has evaluated the impact the CECL accounting model will have on FNCB's accounting, and expects to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjust ment to reduce the allowance for loan lo sses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. FNCB will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings as of the adoption date. Management currently estimates the allowance for credit losses will be in a range of $11.5 million to $11.8 million, decreas ing the allowance by approximately $2.4 million to $2.6 million. The estimated increase to equity, net of tax, will range from $1.9 million to $2.1 million. The actual impact will depend on a number of internal and external factors including: outstanding loan bala nces, characteristics of FNCB's loan and securities portfolios, macroeconomic conditions, forecast information and management's judgement.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Management evaluates the credit quality of FNCB’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings and is maintained at a level management considers adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. Determining the amount of the ALLL is considered a critical accounting estimate because it re quires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and may require, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL. Additionally, the ALLL is determined, in part, by the composition and size of the loan portfolio. The ALLL consists primarily of two co mponents, a specific component and a general component.

The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loan s, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired lo an is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers all other loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted by qualitative factors. The general reserve component of the ALLL is based on pools of unimpaired loans segreg ated by loan segment and risk rating categories of “Pass”, “Special Mention” or “Substandard and Accruing.” Historical loss factors and various qualitative factors are applied based on the risk profile in each risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related to those loans. Substandard loans on non-accrual status above the $100 thousand loan relationshi p threshold and all loans considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are classified as impaired.

To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices for similar assets or models using inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of observable inputs or if markets are illiquid, valuation techniques are used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (Level 3). For Level 3 inputs, valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to, cash flows, discount rates, adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity, and liquidation values. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs.

Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgement is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in FNCB’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. FNCB records an income tax provision or benefit based on the amount of tax currently payable or receivable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes re flect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial an d tax reporting purposes. Management conducts quarterly assessments of all available positive and negative evidence to determine the amount of deferr ed tax assets that will more likely than not be realized.

In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers past operating results, estimates of futu re taxable income based on approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgement about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period depending on the related circumstances. The recognition of deferred tax assets requir es management to make significant as sumptions and judgements about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which may result in equity and earnings volatility because such chan ges are reported in current period earnings. Management’s evaluation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary for net deferred tax assets. In connection with determining the income tax provision or benefit, management considers maintaining liabilities for uncertain tax positions and tax strategies that it believes contain an element of uncertainty. Periodically, management evaluates each of FNCB’s tax positions and strategies to determine whether a liability for uncertain tax benefits is required. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, manage ment determined that FNCB did not have any uncertain tax positions or tax strategies and that no liability was required to be recorded.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The following overview should be read in conjunction with this MD&A in its entirety. Results of Operations Net income in 2022 amounted to $20.4 million, or $1.03 pe r diluted common share, a decreas e of $1.0 million, or 4.4%, compared to $21.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share, in 2021. The decrease in 2022 net income compared to 2021 was primarily due to increases in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Non-interest expense was $35.5 million in 2022, an increase of $4.4 million, or 14.2%, from $31.1 million in 2021, which re flected a $2.6 million, or 15.5%, increase in salaries and employee benefits. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $1.8 million to $2.0 million in 2022, from $166 thousand in 2021, due primarily to higher loan volume.

Return on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity equaled 1.21% and 15.55%, respectively, in 2022, compared to 1.36% and 13.46%, respectively, in 2021. FNCB paid dividends to holders of common stock of $0.33 per share in 2022, an increase of $0.06 per share, or 22.2%, compared to $0.27 per share in 2021. Total dividends declared and paid in 2022 equated to a dividend yield of approximately 4.0% based on the closing stock price of $8.21 per share on December 31, 2022. The dividend payout ratio was 31.9% in 2022 compared to 25.4% in 2021. Balance Sheet Profile Total assets increased $81.2 million, or 4.9%, to $1.746 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.664 billion at December 31, 2021. The balance sheet expansion primarily reflected substantial increases in loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\"), partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. Loans and leases, net of ALLL, increased $143.1 million, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion at December 31, 2022 from $967.0 million at December 31, 2021.

Management’s Focus in 2022 Management continued to navigate through the lingering challenges of the pandemic and manage the rising rate environment, during 2022, while staying focused on several key strategic initiatives which included: strong organic loan growth, new product offerings and effectively managing funding costs. FNCB is always looking to improve the customer experience by further expanding and enhancing FNCB's digital and traditional product and service offerings; while continuing to create efficiency within FNCB's branch netw ork and delivery channels; and investing in strategic business alliances and opportunities to advance financial performance over the long-term. In 2022, FNCB's new commercial equipment financing and leasing product offerings, operating under 1st Equipment Finance were fully integrated and have exceeded management's expectations. This along with the purchase of several third- party originated loan pools, allowed us to diversify FNCB's loan portfolio, reduce risk and enhance net interest income run rates going forward. In addition, during 2022, FNCB acquired Chiaro Investment Services, LLC which was combined with FNCB's Wealth Management team, and is now operating under a new brand, 1st Investment Service, out of FNCB Bank's Exeter Community Office, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

The project will consist of 36 newly constructed senior housing units, located on Dickson Ave, in the Green Ridge section of Scranton, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. This project is expected to provide much needed housing for low- income senior citizens, while revitalizing a large vacant lot in the city and is in line with FNCB's larger Community Caring initiative. One hundred percent (100.0%) of the rental units will qualify for Federal Low-Housing Tax credits (\"LIHTCs\") as provided for in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. FNCB made an initial contribution of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, upon closing the part nership agreement. The remaining obligation of $8.8 million, which is included on other liabilities in the consolidated stat ements of financial condition at December 31, 2022, will be contributed over a series of draws over the following 18-month period according to the construction schedule.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Net Interest Income Net interest income is the difference between (i) interest income, interest and fees on interest-earning assets, and (ii) interest expense, interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income represents the largest component of FNCB’s operating income and, as such, is the prim ary determinant of profitability. Net interest income is impacted by variations in the volume, rate and composition of earning assets and interest -bearing liabilities, changes in general market interest rates and the level of non-performing assets. Interest income is shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis using the corporate statutory tax rate of 21.0% in 2022, 2021 and 2020. In response to the economic uncertainty from the global COVID-19 pandemic, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate 150 basis points in two emergency actions in March 2020. As a result, the target range for federal funds fell from 1.50%-1.75% at December 31, 2019 to 0.00%-0.25% at March 31, 2022 and had remained at these historically low levels through March 15, 2022. Supply chain constraints, the war in Ukraine and lingering effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, among other things, have resulted in rapid rise in price inflation. As a result, the FOMC, in an effort to lower inflation to its 2.0% objective, began t ightening U.S. monetary policy in 2022. Specifically, the FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate seven times for a total of 425 basis points during 2022, whic h included additional upward movements in the fourth quarter of", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 39, "chunk_id": 127}}

This dramatic shift to tighten monetary policy has resulted in a rapid rise in general market interest rates. Competition for depo sits within FNCB's market area has intensified reflective of industrywide liquidity pressures and rate-sensitivity of depo sitors. Higher interest rates, coupled with the increased competition, has resulted in significant increases in deposit an d wholesale funding costs that have surpassed increases in earning asset yields, which has caused interest margin and rate spread compression. Management anticipates that additional tightening actions by the FOMC in 2023, could result in further contraction of FNCB's tax-equivalent net interest margin and rate spread. Additionally, net interest income, earning assets yields and the net interest margin for the period ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the activity related to PPP loans, including the timing of forgiveness and recognition of net loan origination fees. Tax-equivalent net interest income increased $5.3 million, or 10.5%, to $55.2 million in 2022 compared to $49.9 million in 2021. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income wa s due to an increase in tax-equivalent interest income reflecting higher earning asset volumes and yields, partially offset by an increase in interest expense which resulted primarily from increased utilization of wholesale funding costs and higher funding costs.

Additionally, the magnitude and velocity of the rate increases in 2022 has led to a decrease in FNCB's rate spread, the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, as funding costs increased to a greater extent than asset yields.

Despite continued economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures due to remnants of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain constraints and other factors such as the war in Ukraine, which have resulted in monetary policy tightening, FNCB's asset quality metrics have remained mostly favorable throughout 2022 and 2021.

The 3.5% decrease in non-interest income primarily from an unfavorable change in market value of equity securities and a net loss on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities, coupled with reductions in net gains on the sale of mortgages held for sale, and loan-related fees. Stock market volatility resulted in FNCB recoding a net loss on equity securities of $34 thousand in 2022, compared to a net gain of $735 thousand recorded in 2021. Additionally, FNCB recorded a net loss on the sale of available-for sale debt securities of $223 thousand in 2022, compared to a net gain of $213 thousand in 2021, a decrease of $436 thousand, or 204.7%. Net gains on the sale of mortgages held for sale decreased $147 thousand, or 41.8%, to $205 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $352 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as pricing margins on loans and the volume of loan sales decreased due to the rapid rise in market interest rates. Loan-related fees decreased $147 thousand, or 37.7%, to $243 thousand in 2022 from $390 thousand in 2021, which was largely due to a reduction in loan servicing and letter of credit fees. Additionally, FNCB recorded income associated with BOLI death benefit claims of $273 thousand in 2022 and $426 thousand in 2021, a decrease of $153 thousand, or 35.9%.

Partially offsetting these decreases in non-interest income, we re increases in deposit service charges, BOLI income, loan referral fees, merchant services revenue and other income. Loan referral fees, which include fees received from third-party counterparties related to various commercial loan interest rate swap transactions and fees received for the referral of FHA residential mortgage loans to a third-party broker, increased $119 thousand. The decrease in these fees reflected a reduction in the number and volume of such transactions in 2022 as compared to 2021. Deposit service charges increased $538 thousand, or 13.9%, to $4.4 million in 2022, compared to $3 .9 million in 2021, which was pr imarily due to increases in transactional-related charges, check ca rd fees and wire transfer fees. Duri ng 2022, FNCB purchased $3.0 million in additional BOLI policies, which was the primary factor fo r the $169 thousand, or 31.2%, increase in BOLI income. Comparing 2022 and 2021, loan referral fees and merchant services revenue each increased by $119 thousand. Loan referral fees include fees received from third-part y counterparties to commerc ial loan interest rate sw ap transactions and fees received for the referral of FHA residentia l mortgage loans to a third-party broker . The 164.8% increase in loan referral fees largely reflected an increase in the number and volume of such transaction due to changing market conditions, while the 20.1% increase in revenue from merchant services resulted primarily from an increase in card processing revenue due to the continued shift to e-commerce.

{"text": "36 As previously mentioned, on September 30, 2022 FNCB announced that the Bank had entered into an asset purchase agreement with Chiaro Investment Services, LLC, which was combined into the Bank's investment arm and now operates under the new brand as 1st Investment Services. As a result of this transaction, FNCB anticipates an increase in income from wealth management services in 2023. On October 26, 2022, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (\"CFPB\") issued supervisory guidance which warned financial institutions that levying overdraft fees to consumer s who would not reasonably anticipate the fees may constitute an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protec tion Act of 2010 (\"CFPA\"). In addition, the CFPB issued a compliance bulletin warning that certain depositor fees may similarly violate the CFPA. This guidance comes as a next step in the CFPB’s “junk fee” initiative, launched in January 2022, through which the CFPB has endeavored to identify and take certain steps to curb potentially exploitative fees charged by banks and other financial institutions. While management does not believe that FNCB's overdraft fees are in violation of the CFPA, the banking industry, in general, experienced a significant reduction in overdraft fee income in 2022, as many larger financial institutions have eliminated overdraft charges on consumer checking accounts. Competition from large banks and the imposition of restrictions on overdraft fees by the federal government may result in FNCB having to change its overdraft fee structure, which could negatively impact future non- interest income run rates.

The increase resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, data processing expenses, regulatory assessments and other operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.6 million, or 15.5%, to $19.3 million in 2022 from $16.7 million in 2021. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to higher full-time salaries, payroll taxes and benefits associated with staff additions. Also factoring into the increase in sa laries and employee benefits were increases in employment retirement plan contributions and incentive pay. Recognizing the impact of inflation on employees, at the end of 2022, FNCB awarded each employee a one-time employee appreciation bonus to alleviate some of the pressure, the aggregate cost of this one-time award was $393 thousand.

Provision for Income Taxes FNCB recorded income tax expense of $4.1 million in 2022, a decrease of $512 thousand, or 11.0%, compared to $4.6 million in 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower taxable income in 2022 as compared to 2021. FNCB's effective tax rate decreased to 16.85% at December 31, 2022, compared to 17.89% at December 31, 2021, which resulted primarily from an increase in tax-exempt income. Management evaluates the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quart erly basis, or more frequently, as necessary, in accordance with guidance set forth in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” and applies the criteria in the guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management determines based on available evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and depend upon management’s estimates and judgments used in their evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. In evaluating available evidence, management considers, among other factors, historical financial performance, expectation of future earnings, the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused, tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management carefully weighs both positive and negative evidence currently available. Management performed an evaluation of FNCB’s deferred tax assets at D ecember 31, 2022 taking into consideration both positive and negative evidence as of that date. Based on this evaluation, management believes that FNCB's future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets. Accordingly, management concluded that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at December 31, 2022 or 2021. FINANCIAL CONDITION Total assets increased $81.2 million, or 4.9%, to $1.746 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.664 billion at December 31, 2021. The balance sheet expansion primarily reflected substantial increases in loans and leases, net of ALLL, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-s ale debt securities. Loans and leases, net of ALLL, increased $143.1 million, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion at December 31, 2022 from $967.0 million at December 31, 2021. Available-for- sale debt securities decreased $46.5 million, or 8.9%, to $476.1 million at December 31 , 2022 from $522.6 million at December 31, 2021, which was caused largely by a decline in the fair value of these se curities due to rising interest rates.

FNCB in creased its utilization of wholesale funding, specifically advances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh, to fund loan growth. As a result, borrowed funds increased $152.1 million, or 501.6%, to $182.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2021. Total shareholders’ equity decreased $43.5 million, or 26.8%, to $118.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $162.5 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in capital was primarily due to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $48.0 million at December 31, 2022, compared to accumulated other compre hensive income of $6.4 milli on at December 31, 2021. The negative change of $54.4 million was related primarily to the depreciation in the fair value of FNCB's available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, and was the main factor contributing to a $2.09 per share, or 25.6% decrease in tangible book value to $6.04 per share at December 31, 2022 from $8.13 per share at December 31, 2021.

FNCB also holds investments, to a lesser extent, in private CMO's, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Additionally, FNCB holds equity investments in the common and preferred stock of certain publicly traded bank holding companies. Except for U.S. government and government-sponsored agencies, there were no securities of any individual issuer that exceeded 10.0% of shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022. The majority of FNCB's debt securities are fixed-rate instruments and inherently subject to interest rate risk, as the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. U.S. Treasury rates increased dramatically in 2022 as the FOMC continued to tighten monetary policy. Additionally, as short-term interest rates moved up sharply, the yield curve was inverted at December 31, 2022, causing spreads between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates to go negative.

The growth in the loan and lease portfolio reflected increases in all major loan categories, which was primarily due to strong organic demand and the new commercial equipment financing product line. In addition, FNCB purchased individual loans and loan pools originated by third-party originators to enhance interest income revenue streams and diversify the loan portfolio. Loan purchases through 2022 included commercial equipment financing, residential mortgages loans and secured and unsecured consumer installment loans. FNCB expanded its commercial credit product offerings to include commercial equipment financing, including simple interest loans and direct finance and municipal leases, through its brand 1st Equipment Finance. The majority of equipment financing is originated through indirect, third-party dealers. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, simple interest loans outstanding under this initiative totaled $78.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively, and are included with commercial and industrial loans.

Residential real estate loans include fixed-rate and variable-ra te, amortizing mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit (\"HELOCs\") and HELCOs with a carve out feature. FNCB primarily underwrites fixed-rate purchase and refinance of residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and provide funding for additional loans. Additionally, FNCB offers a propriety non-saleable mortgage product branded as the WOW mortgage. The WOW mortgage has maturity terms of 10 to 19.5 years and offers customers an attractive fixed interest rate and low closing costs. Residential real estate loans totaled $250.2 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $16.1 million, or 6.9%, from $234.1 million at December 31, 2021.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that FNCB will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the note and loan agreement. For purposes of the analysis, all TDRs, loan relationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and non-accrual, and loans that are identified as doubtful or loss are considered impair ed. Impaired loans are analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. For collateral-dependent loans, impairme nt is measured based on the fair value of the collateral supporting the loans. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided through the operation or liquidation of the collateral held. For impaired loans that are secured by real estate, management obtains external appraisals annually, or more frequently as warranted, to ascertain a fair value so that the impairment analysis can be updated. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, management may use other valuations sources, including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale.

Under the fair value of collateral method, the impaired amount of the loan is deemed to be the difference between the loan amount and the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated costs to sell. For real estate secured loans, management generally estimates selling costs using a factor of 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, such as a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes, and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. If the valuation indicates that the fair value has deteriorated below the carrying value of the loan, the difference between the fair value and the principal balance is either charged off or a specific reserve is estab lished. For impaired loans for which the value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell exceeds the loan value, the impairment is determined to be zero. For non-collateral-de pendent loans, impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, net of any deferred fees and costs, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Loans to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty that are modified and result in the granting of concessions to the borrowers are classified as TDRs and are considered to be impaired. Such concessions generally involve an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date, a reduction of the stated interest rate, payment modifications, capitalization of property taxes with respect to mortgage loans or a combination of these modifica tions.

{"text": "44 Non-performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of FNCB’s loan review process. Additionally, work-out for non-performing loans and OREO are actively monitored thro ugh the Credit Risk Management Committee. A potential loss on a non-performing asset is generally determined by comparing the outstanding loan balance to the fair market value of the pledged collateral, less estimated cost to sell. Loans are placed on non-accrual when a loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when management believes that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful. This generally occurs when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or when management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that the loan would default before 90 days. FNCB determines delinquency status based on the number of days since the date of the borrower’s last required contractual loan payment. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid interest income is reversed and charged back against current earnings. Any subsequent cash payments received are applied, first to the outstanding loan amounts, then to the recovery of any charged-off loan amounts, with any excess treated as a recovery of lost interest. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when the loan is current as to principal and interest payments, is performing according to contractual terms for six consecutive months and future payments are reasonably assured. Management actively manages impaired loans in an effort to mitigate loss to FNCB by working with customers to develop strategies to resolve borrower difficulties, through sale or liquidation of collateral, foreclosure, and other appropriate means, In addition, management monitors employment and economic conditions within FNCB's mark et area, as weakening of conditions could result in real estate devaluations", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 52, "chunk_id": 167}}

The reduction in non-accrual loans wa s primarily due to the sale to an unrel ated third party of two non-accrual loans to one commercial borrower totaling $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2022. The sale was to another commercial bank with no gain or loss realized on the sale. The $0.9 million decrease in OREO resulted from the sale of one bank-owned property that was held in OREO during the first quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, leasehold improvements of a former branch office that was held in OREO was transferred out and returned to premises and equipment and now serves as an off-site training facility. FNCB’s ratio of non-performing loans to total gr oss loans decreased to 0.25% at December 31, 2022 from 0.39% at December 31, 2021. Similarly, FNCB’s ratio of non-performing assets as a percentage of shareholders’ equity decreased to 3.9% at December 31, 2022 from 4.0% at December 31, 2021. Other non-performing assets was comprised solely of a classified account receivable, the balance of which was $1.8 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The receivable is secured by an evergreen letter of credit that was received in 2011 as part of a settlement agreement for a large construction, land acquisition and development loan for a residential development project in the Pocono region of Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

Management continues to closely monitor this project and has noted an increase in construction activity related to this project including the construction of two additional six- or eight-unit buildings and further site development including building pads for a new six-seven unit building and pool/spa building during 2022. Additionally, the developer has increased marketing and sales initiatives for the project.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The ALLL represents management’s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The ALLL is analyzed in accordance with GAAP and is maintained at a level that is based on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL in relation to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. As part of its evaluation, management considers qualitative and environmental factors, including, but not limited to: ● changes in national, local, and business economic conditions and developments, including the condition of various market se gments; ● chan ges in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; ● changes in lending policies and procedures, including unde rwriting standards, collection, charge-off and recovery practices and results; ● chan ges in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; ● chan ges in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the Board of Directors; ● changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans, including trends in the volume of non-accrual loans,", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 54, "chunk_id": 174}}

Evaluations are intrinsically subjective, as the results are estimated based on management knowledge and experience and are subject to interpretation and modification as information becomes available or as future events occur. Management monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis with emphasis on weakness in both the real estate market and the economy in general and its effect on repayment. Adjustments to the ALLL are ma de based on management’s asse ssment of the factors noted above. For purposes of management’s analysis of the ALLL, all loan relationships with an aggregate balance greater than $100 thousand that are rated substandard and non-accrual, identified as doubtful or loss, and all TDRs are considered impaired and are analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. Circumstances such as construction delays, declining real estate values, and the inability of the borrowers to make scheduled payments have resulted in these loan relationships being classified as impaired.

For non-collateral-dependent loans and TDRs, FNCB measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. With regard to collateral-dependent loans, appraisals are received at least annually to ensure that impairment measurements reflect current market conditions. Should a curr ent appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, other valuation sources including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale may be used. Only downward adjustments are made based on these supporting values. Included in all impairment calculations is a cost to sell adjustment of approximately 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, including a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process.

The ALLL equaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2022, an in crease of $1.8 million, or 14 .3%, from $12.4 million at December 31, 2021. The increase re sulted from a provision for loan and lease lo sses of $2.0 million offset by net charge- offs of $185 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in credit provisioning in 2022 was largely due to the increase in loan volumes as FNCB's assets quality metrics were favorable throughout the year. The ALLL consists of both specific and general components. The component of the ALLL that is related to impaired loans that are individually evaluated for impairment, the guidance for which is provided by ASC 310 “ Impairment of a Loan” (“ASC 310”), was $34 thousand, or 0.2% , of the total ALLL at December 31, 20 22, compared to $26 thousand, or 0.2%, of the total ALLL at December 31, 2021. A general re serve of $14.2 millio n was established for loans analyzed collectively under ASC 450 “ Contingencies” (“ASC 450”), which represented 99.8 % of the total ALLL of $14.2 million at December 31, 2022. Included in the general component of the ALLL were unallocated reserves of $1.1 million, for both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

FNCB’s liquidity position is impacted by several factors, which include, among others, loan and lease orig ination volumes, loan, lease and investment maturity structure and cash flows, deposit demand and time deposit maturity structure and reten tion. FNCB has liquidity and contingent funding policies in place that are designed with controls in place to provide advanced detection of potentially significant funding shortfalls, establish methods for assessing and monitoring risk levels, and institute prompt responses that may alleviate a potential liquidity crisis. Management monitors fluctuations in FNCB’s liquidity position daily and forecasts future liquidity needs. Additionally, management performs periodic stress tests on FNCB's liquidity position that attempt to model in varying degrees of stress in order to proactively develop strategies to ensure adequate liquidity at all times. Additionally, management regularly monitors FNCB's wholesale funding sources taking into consideration the cost of f unds, diversification between funding sources and asset/liability management strategies. FN CB utilizes brokered deposits, including one-way purchases through the IntraFi SM Network, deposits acquired through a national listing service, as well as overnight and term advances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh as wholesale sources of funds to supplement its deposit gathering initiatives. The statements of cash flows present the change in cash and cash equivalents from operating, investing and financing activities.

Additionally, cash outflows for purchases of available-for- sale debt securities, net of inflows for sales, maturities, ca lls and repayments, were $26.2 million in 2022. Also contributing to the net cash outflow for investing activities were purchases of $6.6 million in restricted stock, $3.2 million in equity securities, $3.0 million in new BOLI policies and $2.2 million for the initial investment in a LIHTC program. Financing activities provided $107.5 million in net cash, which resulted primarily from the proceeds from overnight and net term advances through the FHLB of P ittsburgh, of $139.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively.

FNCB’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to FNCB. Bank regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agency. Cash dividends declared and paid by FNCB during 2022 and 2021 were $0.33 per share and $0.27per share, respectively.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to measure the FNCB’s financial position and operating results primarily in te rms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on FNCB's operations is primarily related to increases in operating expenses. Management considers changes in interest rates to impact our financial condition and results of operations to a far greater degree than changes in prices due to inflation.

Additionally, inflation may adversely impact the financial condition of FNCB's borrowers and could impact their ability to repay their loans, which could negatively affect FNCB's asset quality through higher delinquency rates and increased charge-offs. Management will carefully consider the impact of inflation and rising interest rates on FNCB borrowers in managing credit risk related to the loan and lease portfolio. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Market risk is the risk to earnings and/or financial position resulting from adverse changes in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. FNCB’s exposure to market risk is primarily interest rate risk associated with our lending, investing and deposit gathering activities, all of which are other than trading. Changes in interest rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. In addition, variations in interest rates affect the underlying economic value of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items.

Members of ALCO meet quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, to develop balance sheet strategies affecting the future level of net interest income, liquidity and capital. The major objectives of ALCO are to: ● manage exposure to changes in the interest rate environment by limiting the changes in net interest margin to an acceptable level within a reasonable range of interest rates; ● ensure adequate liquidit y and funding; ● maintain a stron g capital base; and ● maximize net interest income opportunities. ALCO monitors FNCB’s exposure to changes in net interest income over both a one-year planning horizon and a longer- term strategic horizon. ALCO uses net interest income simulations and economic value of equity (“EVE”) simulations as the primary tools in measuring and managing FNCB’s position and considers balance sheet forecasts, FNCB's liquidity position, the economic environment, anticipated direction of interest ra tes and FNCB’s earnings sensitivity to changes in these rates in its modeling. In addition, ALCO has established policy tolerance limits for accept able negative changes in net interest income. Furthermore, as part of its ongoing monitoring, ALCO requires quarterly back testing of modeling results, which involves after-the-fact comparisons of projections with FNCB’s actual performance to measure the validity of assumptions used in the modeling techniques.

Specifically, given the current market rates, ALCO looks at “earnings at risk” to determine anticipated changes in net interest income from a base case scenario with scenarios of + 200, +400 and -100 basis points for simulation purposes. The simulation takes into consideration that not all assets and liabilities re-price equally and simultaneously with market rates (i.e., savings rate). Economic Value at Risk While earnings-at-risk simulation measures the short-term risk in the balance sheet, economic value (or por tfolio equity) at risk measures the long-term risk by finding the net present value of the future cash flows from FNCB’s existing assets and liabilities. ALCO examines this ratio regularly, and given the current rate environment, has utilized rate shocks of +200, +400 and -100 basis points for simulation purposes. Management recognizes that, in some instances, this ratio may contradict the “earnings at risk” ratio. While ALCO regularly performs a wide variety of simulations under various strategic balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios, the following results reflect FNCB’s sensitivity ov er the subsequent twelve months based on the following assumptions: ● asset and liabilit y levels as of December 31, 2022 as a starting point; ● cash flows are based on contractual maturity and amortization schedules with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources; and ● cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments to keep interest-earning asset and interest- bearing liability levels constant.", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 63, "chunk_id": 201}}

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

{"text": "58 Allowance for Loan Losses – Qualitative Factor Adjustments Critical Audit Matter Description As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses and represents an amount, which, in management’s judgment will be adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio. In calculating the general reserve component, management considered historical loss experience by segment and qualitative factor adjustments for changes not reflected in the historical loss experience. The general reserve component of the Company’s allowance for loan losses involved consideration of national and local economic conditions, levels of and trends in classified loans, delinquency rates and non-accrual loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, changes in lending policies, lending personnel, and collateral, as well as concentrations in loan types, industry, and geography. The adjustments for qualitative factors require a significant amount of judgment by management and involve a high degree of estimation uncertainty. We identified the qualitative factor component of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter as auditing the underlying qualitative factors required significant auditor judgment as amounts determined by management rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes significant estimation uncertainty. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: ● Obtaining an understanding of the relevant contro ls related to the allowance for loan losses and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to management's establishment, review, and approval of the qualitative factors, and the completeness and accurac y of data used in determining qualitative factors. ● Evaluation of the appropriateness of management's methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses. ● Testing of the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining qualitative factor adjustments by agreeing", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 66, "chunk_id": 209}}

{"text": "64 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. ORGANIZATION FNCB Bancorp, Inc. is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1997. It is the parent company of FNCB Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiaries FNCB Realty Company, Inc., FNCB Realty Company I, LLC, and FNCB Realty Company II, LLC. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “FNCB” is used to refer to FNCB Bancorp, Inc., and its subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, however, the term “FNCB” refers to FNCB Bancorp, Inc., itself. The Bank provides customary retail and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and local governments and municipalities through its 16 full-service branch locations, as of December 31, 2022, within its primary market area, Northeastern Pennsylvania. FNCB Realty Company, Inc., FNCB Realty Company I, LLC, and FNCB Realty Company II, LLC, which were formed to hold real estate and/or operate businesses acquired in exchange for debt settlement or foreclosure, were inactive at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In December 2006, First National Community Statutory Trust I (“Issuing Trust”), which is wholly owned by FNCB, was formed under Delaware law to provide FNCB with an additional funding source through the issuance of pooled trust preferred securities. FNCB has adopted Accounting Standards Codificati on (“ASC”) 810-10, Consolidation, for the Issuing Trust. Accordingly, the Issuing Trust has not been consolidated with the accounts of FNCB, because FNCB is not the primary beneficiary of the trust. Note 2.

{"text": "trust. Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of FNCB are comprised of the accounts of FNCB Bancorp, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, FNCB Bank, as well as the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and reporting policies of FNCB conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Regulation S-X and general practices within the banking industry. Prior period amounts have been reclassified when necessary to conform to the cu rrent year’s presentation. Such reclassifications did not have a material impact on the operating results or financial position of FNCB. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and di sclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of t he consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term are the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ ALLL”), the valuation and impairment evaluation of FNCB's investments, and income taxes. Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks.

If the qualitative assessment indicates impairment, the security is written down to its fair value, with the charge for impairment included in net income. Evaluation for Other Than Temporary Impairment On a quarterly basis, management evaluates all securities in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”). An individual security is considered impaired when its current fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. As part of its evaluation, management considers the following factors, among other things, in determining whether the security’s impairment is other than temporary: ● the len gth of time and extent of the impairment; ● the causes of the decline in fair value, such as credit de terioration, interest rate fluctuations, or market volatility; ● adverse industr y or geographic conditions; ● historical implied volatilit y; ● payment structure of the security and whether FNCB expects to receive all contractual cash flows; ● failure of the issuer to make contractual interest or principal pa yments in the past; and ● chan ges in the security’s rating. Based on current authoritative guidance, when a held-to-matu rity or available-for-sale security is assessed for OTTI, management must first consider (a) whether it intends to sell the security and (b) whether it is more likely than not the FNCB will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. If one of these circumstances applies to a security, an OTTI loss is recognized in the statement of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below amortized cost.

If neither of these circumstances ap plies to a security, but FNCB does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost, an OTTI loss has occurred that must be separated into two categories: (a) the amount related to credit loss and (b) the amount related to other factors (such as market risk). In assessing the level of OTTI attributable to credit loss, management compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected with the amortized cost of the security. The portion of the total OTTI related to credit loss is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as estimated based on cash flow projections disc ounted at the applicable original yield of the security, and is recognized in earnings, while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The total OTTI loss is presented in the statement of income less the po rtion recognized in other comprehensive income. When a debt security becomes other-than-temporarily im paired, its amortized cost basis is reduced to reflect the portion of the total impairment related to credit loss.

Loans and leases receivable are presented net of the allo wance for loan and lease losses in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest income on all loans is recognized using the effective interest method. Nonrefundable loan origination fees, as well as certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and the net amount amortized over the contractual life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Amortization of deferred loan fees or costs is discontinued when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when a loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when management believes that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful. This generally occurs when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or when management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that the loan would default before 90 days. FNCB determines delinquency status based on the number of days since the date of the borrower’s last required contractual loan payment.

In accordance with federal regulations, prior to making, extending, renewing or advancing additional funds in excess of $500 thousand on a loan secured by real estate , FNCB requires an appraisal of the property by an independent, state-certified or state-licensed appraiser (depending upon collateral type and loan amount) that is approved by the Board of Directors. Appraisals are reviewed internally or by an independent third party engaged by FNCB. Generally, management obtains a new appraisal when a loan is deemed impaired. These appraisals may be more limited in scope than those obtained at the initial underwriting of the loan. Troubled Debt Restructurings FNCB considers a loan to be a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) when it grants a concession to the borrower for legal or economic reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficultie s that it would not otherwise consider. Such concessions granted generally involve a reduction of the stated interest rate , an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date, a payment modification under a forbearance agreement, a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan, capitalization of real estate taxes, or a combination of these modifications.

Loan Impairment A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that FNCB will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the note and loan agreement. For purposes of the analysis, all TDRs, loan relationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and non-accrual, and loans that are identified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired . Impaired loans are analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. For collateral-dependent loans, impairme nt is measured based on the fair value of the collateral supporting the loans. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided through the operation or liquidation of the collateral held. For impaired loans that are secured by real estate, external appraisals are generally obtained annually, or more frequently as warranted, to ascertain a fair value so that the impairment analysis can be updated. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, other sources of valuation may be used including current letters of inte nt, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Management evaluates the credit quality of FNCB’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings and is maintained at a level that management considers adequa te to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. Determining the amount of the ALLL is considered a criti cal accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the am ount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.

Banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and may require, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL. Additionally, the ALLL is determined, in part, by the composition and size of the loan portfolio. FNCB's allowance methodology consists primarily of two components, a specific component and a general component. The specific component relates to loans that ar e classified as impaired. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market pric e of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers all other loans and is based on historical loss expe rience adjusted by qualitative factors. The general reserve component of the ALLL is based on pools of unimpaired loans segregated by loan segment and risk rating categories of “Pass”, “Special Mention” or “Substandard and Accruing.” Historical loss factors and various qualitative factors are applied based on the risk profile in each risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related to those loans. Substandard loans on non-accrual status above the $100 thousand loan relationship threshold and all loans considered TDRs are classified as impaired.

Additionally, loans in this category include loans for land acquisition, secure d by raw land.

Loans for undeveloped real estate are subject to a loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 65%. Construction loans are treated similarly to the developed real estate loans and are subject to a maximum loan to value ratio of 85% based upon an “as-completed” appraised valu e. Construction loans generally yield a higher interest rate than other mortgage loans but also carry more risk. Commercial Real Estate - These loans represent the largest portion of FNCB’s total loan portfolio and loans in this portfolio generally carry larger loan balances. The commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio consists of owner-occupied and non- owner-occupied properties that are secured by a broad range of real estate, including but not limited to, office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, warehouses, gas stations, convenien ce markets, residential care facilities, nursing care facilities, restaurants and multifamily", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 75, "chunk_id": 233}}

Commercial and Industrial - FNCB offers commercial loans at various rates a nd terms to businesses located in its primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes revolving lines of credit, automobile floor plans, equipment loans, vehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans generally carry a higher risk than commercial real estate loans by the nature of the underlying collateral, which can be mach inery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, vehicles or marketable securities. Generally, a collateral lien is placed on the collateral supporting the loan. To reduce the risk associated with these loans, management may attempt to secure real estate as collateral and obtain personal guarantees of the borrower as deemed necessary. State and Political Subdivision - FNCB originates general oblig ation notes, municipal leases and tax anticipation loans to state and political subdivisions, which are primarily municipalities in FNCB’s market area. Residential Real Estate - FNCB offers fixed-rate 1 - 4 family residential loans. Residential first lien mortgages are generally subject to an 80% loan to value ratio based on the appraised value of the property. FNCB will generally require the mortgagee to purchase Private Mortgage Insurance if the amount of the loan exceeds the 80% loan to value ratio. Residential mortgage loans are generally smaller in size and are considered homogeneous as they exhibit similar characteristics.

FNCB is in the business of underwriting indirect auto loans which are originated through various auto dealers in northeastern Pennsylvania and dealer floor plan loans. Consumer loans are generally smaller in size and exhibit homogeneous characteristics. Off-Balance-Sheet Credit-Related Financial Instruments FNCB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet ri sk in the normal course of business to meet the financing need of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused portions of lines of credit, including revolving HELOCs, and letters of credit. FNCB’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. FNCB uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. In order to provide for probable losses inherent in these instruments, FNCB records a reserve for unfunded commitments, included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with the offsetting expense recorded in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranche. If management later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Other Real Estate Owned OREO consists of property acquired by foreclosure, abandonment or conveyance of deed in-lieu of foreclosure of a loan, and bank premises that are no longer used for operations or for future expansion. OREO is held for sale and is initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acqui sition or transfer, which estab lishes a new cost basis.

Revenue Recognition FNCB records revenue from contracts w ith customers in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" FNCB recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. FNCB's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's loans, investment securities and other financial instruments, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. FNCB has evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the consolidated statements of income was not necessary. In general, FNCB fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and the transaction prices are typically fixed and charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity.

Revenue is recognized when FNCB’s performance obligation is completed which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts. Also included in deposit service charges is income from ATM surcharges and de bit card services income. ATM surcharges are generated when an FNCB cardholder uses an ATM that is not within the AllPoint ATM network or a non-FNCB cardholder uses an FNCB ATM. Card services income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever a customer uses an FNCB debit card as payment for goods and/or services through a card payment network. FNCB’s performance obligation is satisfied on a daily basis as transactions are processed. FNCB recognizes ATM surcharges and card services income as transactions with merchants are settled, generally on a daily basis. ● Net gains (losses) on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities - Gains or losses realized from the sale of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to non-interest income on the settlement date. ● Net gains (losses) on the sale of equity securities - Gains or losses realized from the sa le of equity securities are recorded to non-interest income on the settlement date. ● Net gains (losses) on", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 79, "chunk_id": 246}}

Comprehensive (Loss) Income Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unr ealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the shareholders’ equity section of the statement of financial condition, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive (loss) income. New Authoritative Accounting Guidance Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” replaces the current loss impairment methodology under GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates in an effort to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 is commonly referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") and requires that a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount exp ected to be collected. The amendm ents in this update affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fa ir value through net income, including such financial assets as loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 80, "chunk_id": 249}}

On June 17, 2016, the fo ur, federal financial institution regulatory ag encies (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), issued a joint statem ent to provide information about ASU 2016-13 and the initial supervisory views regarding the implementation of the new st andard. The joint statement applies to all banks, savings associations, credit unions and financial institution holding companies, regardless of asset size. The statement details the key elements of, and the steps necessary for, the successful transition to the new accounting standard. In addition, the statement notifies financial institutions that because the appropriate allowance levels are institution-specific amounts, the agencies will not establish benchmark targets or ranges for the change in institutions’ allowance levels upon adoption of the ASU, or for allowance levels going forward.

The preferred stock pays quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 8.25%, which commenced on March 30, 2021. The preferred stock of this bank holding company is not traded on any established market and is accounted for as an equity security without a determinable fair value. Under GAAP, an equity security without a readily determinable fair value shall be written down to its fair values if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. As part of its qualitative assessment, management engaged an independent third party to provide valuations of this investment as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which indicated that the investment was not impaired. Accordingly, management determined that no adjustment for impairment was required at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Additions to the ALLL are provided by charges against income based on various factors which, in manageme nt’s judgement, deserve current recognition of estimated probable losses. Loan and lease losses are charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Generally, FNCB will record a loan charge-off (including a partial charge-off) to reduce a loan to the estimated recoverable amount based on its methodology detailed below. Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio and makes adjustments for loan losses in order to maintain the ALLL in accordance with GAAP. The ALLL consists primarily of the following two components: (1) Specific allowances are established for impaired loan s, which FNCB defines as all loan relationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and on non-accrual, loans rated doubtful or loss, and all TDRs. The amount of impairment provided for as an allowance is represented by the deficiency, if any, between the carrying value of the loan and either (a) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, (b) the loan’s observable market price, or (c) the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, fo r collateral dependent loans. Impaired loans that have no impairment losses are not c onsidered in the establishment of general va luation allowances as described below. If management determines that collection of the impairment amount is remote, a charge-off will be recorded for the impairment amount. (2) General allowances are established for loan losses on a portfolio basis", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 86, "chunk_id": 268}}

If management determines that collection of the impairment amount is remote, a charge-off will be recorded for the impairment amount. (2) General allowances are established for loan losses on a portfolio basis for loans that do not meet the definition of impaired. FNCB divides its portfolio into loan segments for loans exhibiting similar characteristics. Loans rated special mention or substandard and accruing, which are embedded in these loan segments, are then separated from these loan segments, as these loans are subject to an analys is that emphasizes the credit risk associated with these loans. An estimated loss rate is then applied to each loan segment, which are based on FNCB’s own historical loss experience for each respective loan segment. In addition, management evaluates and applies to each loan segment certain qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with FNCB’s existing portfolio to differ from historical experience, which are discussed below. For loans that have an internal credit rating of special mention or substandard, the qualita tive and environmental factors are further adjusted for the increased risk. In addition to the specific and general components, management may establish an unallocated allowance that is used to cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may have not been identified under the methodology.", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 86, "chunk_id": 269}}

FNCB main tains a formal, written loan classification and credit grading system that includes a discussion of the factors used to assign appropriate classifications of credit grades to loans. The risk grade groupings provide a mechanism to identify risk within the loan portfolio and provide management and the board of directors with periodic reports by risk category. The process also identifies groups of loans that warrant the special attention of management. Accurate and timely loan classification and credit grading is a critical component of loan portfolio management.

Quarterly, FNCB engages an independent third party to assess the quality of the loan portfolio and evaluate the accuracy of ratings with the loan officer’s and management’s assessment. FNCB’s loan rating system assigns a degree of risk to commercial loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. Management analyzes these non-homogeneous loans individually by grading the loans as to credit risk and probability of collection for each type of loan. Commercial and industrial loans include commercial indirect auto loans which are not in dividually risk rated, and construction, land acquisition and development loans include residential construction loans which are also not individually risk rated. These loans are monitored on a pool basis due to their homogeneous nature as described in “Credit Quality Indicators – Other Loans” below. FNCB risk rates certain residential real estate loans and consumer loans that are part of a larger commercial relationship using a credit grading system as described in “Credit Quality Indicators – Commercial Loans.” The grading system contains the following basic risk categories: 1.

DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives FNCB is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. It principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. FNCB manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, FNCB enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from busin ess activities that resu lt in the receipt or payment of future unknown and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of known or expected cash payments primarily related to FNCB's borrowings. FNCB's existing credit derivatives result from loan participations arrangements, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in FNCB's assets or liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk FNCB's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to a dd stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, FNCB primarily uses interest ra te swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 98, "chunk_id": 295}}

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on FNCB's variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, it is estimated that an additional $604 thousand will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. Non-designated Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service FNCB provides to certain customers. FNCB executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simu ltaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that FNCB executes with a third party, such that FNCB minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the stri ct hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsettin g swaps are recognized directly in earnings.

REGULATORY MATTERS/SUBSEQUENT EVENTS FNCB’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, or repurcha se shares of its common stock, is largely dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to FNCB. Bank regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid, or shares that may be repurchased, without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agency. Cash dividends declared and paid by FNCB during 2022 and 2021 were $0.33 per share and $0.27 per share, respectively. FNCB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase plan (\"DRP\") to its shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 dividend reinvestment shares were purchased in open market transactions.

{"text": "101 Note 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In determining fair value, FNCB uses various valuation ap proaches, including market, in come and cost approaches. Accounting standards establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing th e asset or liability, which are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of FNCB. Unobservable inputs reflect FNCB’s knowledge about the assumptions the market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, which are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). A financial asset or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on th e lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: ● Level 1 valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets; ● Level 2 valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market data; and ● Level 3 valuation is derived from other valuation method ologies including discounted cash flow models and similar techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market.

These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value. A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value, and for estimating fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value, is set forth below. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities The estimated fair values for FNCB’s investments in obligations of the U.S. government, obligations of state and political subdivisions, government-sponsored agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities, private collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities, negotiable certificates of deposit and certain co rporate debt securities are obtained by FNCB from a nationally-recognized pricing service. This prici ng service develops estimated fair values by analyzing like securities and applying available market information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing (Level 2 inputs ), to prepare valuations. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on qu oted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on th e securities’ relationship to other benchm ark quoted securities. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include, among other things, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, and are based on market data obtained from sources independent from FNCB.

The Level 2 investments in FNCB’s portfolio are priced using those inputs that, based on the analysis prepared by the pricing service, reflect the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets. Management has determined that the Level 2 designation is appropriate for these securities because, as with most fixed-income securities, those in FNCB’s portfolio are not exchange-traded, and such non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are typically priced by correlation to observed market data. FNCB has reviewed the pricing service’s methodology to confirm its understanding that such methodology results in a valuation based on quoted market prices for sim ilar instruments traded in active markets, quoted markets for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions can be corroborated by market data as appropriate to a Level 2 designation. For those securities for which the inputs used by an independe nt pricing service were derived from unobservable market information, FNCB evaluated the appropriateness and quality of each price. Management reviewed the volume and level of activity for all classes of securities and attempted to identif y transactions which may not be orderly or reflective of a significant level of activity and volume. For securities meeting these criteria, the quoted prices received from either market participants or an independent pricing service may be adjusted, as necessary, to estimate fair value (fair values based on Level 3 inputs). If applicable, the adjustment to fair value was derived based on present value cash flow model projections obtained from third party providers using assumptions similar to those incorporated by market", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 109, "chunk_id": 324}}

{"text": "102 At December 31, 2022, FNCB owned 29 corporate debt securities with an aggreg ate amortized cost and fair value of $33.6 million and $30.7 million, respectively. The market for six of th e 29 corporate debt securities at December 31, 2022 was not active and markets for similar securities are also not active. FNCB obtained valuations for these securities from a third-party service provider that prepared the valuations using a market approach that incorporates identifying a population of transactions for similar instruments and an evaluation to cap ture credit risk associated with these bonds. Management takes measures to validate the service pr ovider’s analysis and is actively involv ed in the valuation process, including reviewing and verifying the population and evaluation of credit risk. Managment believes this approach to be a conservative approach as it takes into consideration securities that have lo nger maturities or longer call dates, issuers with smaller asset sizes, and securities with smaller issue amo unts. These factors are typically consider ed to be factors that would add credit spread to a bond, thus resulting in a higher yield. Management believes the valuation results from this market approach to be consistent with pricing and data for similar deals at D ecember 31, 2022. FNCB considers the inputs used in the market approach to be observable Level 3 input s because, while inputs are based on actua l transactions, the relative number of transactions in the population is small and subjective assumptions are used in considering factors considered to incorporate credit spreads into price determination.

Controls and Procedures FNCB’s management, with the participation of the Chief Ex ecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of FNCB’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, FNCB’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded FNCB’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. There were no changes made to FNCB’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to mate rially affect, FNCB’s intern al control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for FNCB Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accountin g principles in the United States and is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accura tely and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipt s and expenditures of the Company are only being made in accordance with authorizations of", "metadata": {"source": "annual.pdf", "page": 118, "chunk_id": 338}}

Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system inherently has limitations and the benefits of controls must be weighed against their costs. Additionally, co ntrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Therefore, no assessment of a cost- effective system of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected. As of December 31, 2022, management of the Company condu cted an assessment of the ef fectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation under the criteria in the Framework, management concluded that the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
