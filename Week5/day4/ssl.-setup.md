# SSL Setup using NGINX and mkcert (Day 4)

This document describes how HTTPS was implemented using NGINX inside Docker with self-signed certificates generated via mkcert. SSL/TLS is terminated at NGINX, while backend services communicate over HTTP inside a secure Docker network.

## Architecture

Browser → HTTPS → NGINX (SSL Termination) → HTTP → Backend-1 / Backend-2

This approach centralizes security, simplifies backend services, and follows real-world production architecture.

## Why HTTPS
HTTP traffic is unencrypted and can be intercepted or modified. HTTPS encrypts data, ensures integrity, and verifies server identity using certificates. Modern browsers require HTTPS for secure communication.

## Why SSL Termination at NGINX
NGINX handles encryption and decryption so backend services remain simple HTTP servers. This improves performance, reduces complexity, and allows centralized certificate management.

## Tools Used
NGINX for reverse proxy and SSL termination, mkcert for generating locally trusted certificates, Docker and Docker Compose for container orchestration.

## mkcert 
sudo apt install -y libnss3-tools mkcert ------ installs mkcert and browser trust dependencies
mkcert -install--------------------------------- creates and installs  local certificate authority (trusted)
mkcert myapp.local------------------------------ generates SSL certificates for the local domain myapp.local
