## Architecture
The API follows a clean layered architecture:
 
- Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses  
- Services apply business logic and validations  
- Repositories build and execute database queries  
- Middleware handles errors centrally

## Query Engine Features
 
# Cursor-Based Pagination
Pagination is implemented using cursor-based pagination instead of `skip/limit`.
 
 
- Products are sorted by `_id` in descending order  
- Cursor represents the `_id` of the **last item** in the current page  
- Next page fetches records where `_id < cursor`  
 
This prevents duplicates, avoids overlaps, and scales efficiently for large datasets.

# Dynamic Filtering, Search & Sorting
Queries are dynamically constructed in the repository layer using request parameters:
 
- Text search on product name  
- Price range filtering (`minPrice`, `maxPrice`)  
- Tag-based filtering  
- Dynamic sorting (ascending / descending)  
- Pagination using `limit` and `cursor`  
 
A single endpoint supports multiple query combinations safely.

# Soft Delete
Products are not permanently removed from the database.
 
- A `deletedAt` timestamp marks a product as deleted  
- Default queries exclude deleted products  
- Deleted products can be included using:
 
# Error Handling
The API implements structured and centralized error handling:
 
**Typed Errors** using a custom error class with HTTP status codes  
**Centralized Error Middleware** to handle all errors in one place  
 
**Unified Error Response Format**:
``` json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "code": 404,
  "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
  "path": "/request/path"
}
