Both a) and b) are true in this case. But not the c. Injury of the spinal cord at C4 level may spare sensations of face and neck as the sensory tracts giving nerves which innervates the dermatomes of face and neck are usually above the level of C4,so these areas usually spared in injury at this level. But the trunk dermatomes innervation are from the spinal segments which are well below this level and injury at this level obviously will transect these tracts and thus will cause sensory loss in trunk region in addition to lower limbs.

It was bruised for sometime but the bruise soon went away. At the moment, I feel no pain but I have a small bump on the inside of my foot, where the bruise used to be, should I be concerned?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, it is callus or million of fracture. You had foot injury 3 weeks ago. And after 3 weeks, you are having bump on trauma site.

It is collection of inflammatory cells and calcium which give rise to appearance of swelling. Another possibility is million. If fractured fragments are not fused correctly then they can give rise to swelling due to million. So better to consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination and x-ray of affected foot."}

Some have been pretty bad but they are not really regular. If I get up and walk they get worse though. I am wondering if I should just go in or if its just braxton hicks.", "output": "Hallow Dear, You are carrying twin pregnancy. Twin pregnancy is prone for premature delivery due to overstretching of the uterus. However, 27 weeks gestation is too early for management of the premature child. The uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing throughout the pregnancy. You have very rightly mentioned them as Braxton Hicks contractions. However, Braxton Hicks contractions are never painful contractions. If you are getting pain also, they could be early labor contractions. Please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. You need to be on the bed and put on uterine relaxants like Albuterol and Rotational preparation like Austen for maintenance. Once the uterine contractions have subsided, then also you should continue to take bed rest. You have yet not completed 28 weeks. So the possibility of week mouth of the uterus (incompetent cervical internal OS) should be ruled out; though it usually does not cause painful uterine contractions for prolonged period. Incompetent internal OS needs cervical stitch for reinforcement which is removed just before delivery. I hope you will take quick action to report to the Obstetrician."}

Appendicitis is more of a clinical diagnosis and sonogram may be a corroborative investigation in arriving at the diagnosis. However, once you are being examined by your treating doctor and the sonogram also shows that you have got acute appendicitis, then the right treatment for this condition is emergency surgery after doing all other routine investigations like blood and urine test. Not infrequently some physician treat this with antibiotics to control the infection without surgery, but this carries the risk of perforation and other complications related to appendix and so I as a surgeon would not advise you for the same. The Blood Pressure checked for you does not need any treatment for the time being as the upper (systolic) level could be due to the pain in abdomen. The vibration in your body is also not related to your present symptoms of pain abdomen. This might be due to the anxiety factor if no other neurological problem is faced by you. I would suggest you to consult a general surgeon at the earliest for management of acute appendicitis. Wishing you an early recovery."}

The emergency contraceptive pill like Posit nor is up to 94% effective in preventing an unwanted pregnancy if it is taken within 72 hours following an unprotected sex.

This hormone is produced right after a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a women uterus. Blood tests are more sensitive than urine tests and may detect pregnancy from about 6 to 8 days after ovulation. The home pregnancy test using an early morning urine sample can be undertaken about a week after missing a period. Hope these answer your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

She also has been vomiting. She underwent a CT of abd/pelvis and all was normal except small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac. Could this be residual fluid from a ruptured ovarian cyst?

Yes, small fluid in the Cul-de-sac has to be bothered about as the age of your daughter is just 13, and we do not get fluids in the abdomen unless there is a problem. It may be a fluid from the ruptured follicle as you are right suspecting, if the dates are coinciding with possible ovulation period, which is normally 14 days prior to the next expected period. If she gets asymptomatic within a few days nothing to worry; you can follow up the fluid with simple ultrasonography. If the condition does not resolve, she will need further studies including the tests of blood, urine and stool and if required Diagnostic Laparoscopy for seeing the interior of the stomach, and to get the fluid for analysis to find the probable cause. The other causes in a child of 13 years can be appendicitis, tuberculosis, primary peritonitis. And so on."}

Previously 8 weeks miscarriage happened 1.5 yrs back d&c done. I am diabatic with irregular periods", "output": "Hallow Dear, You had previous miscarriage of 8 weeks. Hence, you have been prescribed Sustain 200 for being on the safer side. Sustain 200 is a progesterone preparation which helps to stabilize the pregnancy. In the scan, sac was found without heart activity. At 5 weeks, probably it is rather too early for cardiac activity to be noted. A repeat ultrasonography after one week may note the cardiac activity. If cardiac activity is noted, please continue Sustain to keep the pregnancy stabilized. However, if the cardiac activity is not noted even after one week and the margins of the sac are irregular, it is a pregnancy without baby in the gestational sac. This condition is known as Blighted ovum. Such pregnancy does not grow and needs termination of pregnancy if it does not get terminated naturally. So at this stage, continue with Sustain 200, repeat the scan after a week or more and then let the Obstetrician take further decision. I hope, this clarifies your doubts."}

I am a few weeks pregnant and although my t4 is normal 16.6 my tsh is 5.75 - this is the lowest so far. I know about the probs with a high tsh and I will be monitored more later all going well. Is there a cause for concern at this moment.", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I first want to reassure you that women can and do have healthy pregnancies with thyroid disease all the time. In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high. But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development. So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine. It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH. Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the away grows. So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy. I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"}

In the current scenario, your symptoms are more likely to be due to the IUD inside, the hormone effects thereupon. I would suggest a review of the IUD and check if there is any displacement. This can be done through a clinical exam followed by a pelvic scan. Heavy bleeding can be due to the hormone effect of the IUD as well as the uterine irritability. Infection also has to be ruled out. If the position is not disturbed and if there is no sign of any infection, the hormone effect settles down in course of time. Else, removal is the option. Hope this helps."}

I pray you will be able to enlighten me relevant to the causating factors involved?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for providing the brief history of YouScience you mentioned that the pain is constant, and it is making it difficult to stand, sit, turn etc. you need to first lye down on your stomach and keep a hot water bag wrapped up in a towel to provide deep heating, by which muscle spasm comes down. If you do not have any pain in the hip, thigh, calf or feet than you should not worry much. This kind of pain occurs due to either muscle spasm in the lower back or sacro-iliac-joint dysfunction. Usually it takes 5-7 days for inflammation to come down if proper rest is taken. In case if the symptoms don't come down for a safer side you can take an X-ray or an MRI for finding any soft tissue injuries. If the pain is slowing down then you can proceed to meet a physical therapist who can teach you some core strengthening and spine strengthening exercises which will help you more. Never ignore a simple back pain also, as we never know how big it can be or may become. Sometimes due to ignorance the soft tissue injury becomes big and pain level raises.Also, the core muscles and spine muscles are in constant use all the time and their strength is more important for future to avoid any major injuries.

Since its painkillers, these are not good for the pregnancy. Rather taking medicine for pain during pregnancy stick to hot water fermentation and peripartum exercises. This will help to reduce pain and no trouble to the baby as well. Also, as you had back and hip pain I think you have muscle weakness and needs to work out behind it to get it strengthened. If you are planning for a baby do peripartum exercises and not for now. As any abdominal exercises will have negative effects over the baby for now. Wait till the pregnancy duration is over and do pre par tum exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor."}

The inflammatory bowel disease as a cause of it is necessary to be ruled out as this may lead to non-responding persistent abdominal upset. It is advisable to get your stool routine & microscopic examination done & have a consultation from proper gastroenterologist who may ask you to perform few tests such as colonoscopy if needed. The gnats & fruit flies may be the reason for the infection but the won't cause the blood in the stools usually, nor they are responsible for such a long course of abdominal upset. So my advice is that you must have to consult gastroenterologist for this problem."}
