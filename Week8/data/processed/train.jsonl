In my opinion the EDD is calculated basing on LMP and first trimester ultrasound. According to your LMP the EDD is January 8th. If you are doubtful about the dates the first trimester ultrasound helps in knowing the EDD. The EDD given in first trimester ultrasound is confirmatory. So both the EDD s from LMP and first trimester ultrasound are same January 7th is your EDD. As you don't have pains you can wait up to 41 weeks if you don't have any complication and your fetal movements are good. So relax. Even after 41 weeks you don't get pains inducing the labor should be done after assessing the pelvis. Nothing to worry. Best regards..."}

She was tested for strep which was negative as well as mono which was negative as well. The question I have is it normal for her face and cheeks to be quite swollen??", "output": "Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that swelling on both sides of cheeks and face can be due to viral infection of the parotid gland known as Mumps. Mumps also known as \\\"Epidemic Parotitis\\\" is a VIRAL infection, and it can affect either one side or both sides Parotid glands which are major salivary glands leading to the above explained symptoms. The symptoms subside within 7 to 10 days after the symptoms appear. Consult a Physician and get evaluated and investigation like blood test,x-ray and salivary amylase test can help in confirmation of the cause and treatment can be done accordingly. There is no exact treatment for mumps and only symptomatic relief can be provided. For pain, you can take Acetaminophen or Tylenol for relief. Doing cold compresses can be relieving. Take plenty of fluids which can include water, fruit juices, soups etc. Take a soft and nutritious diet. Take sufficient rest. In case if the symptoms persist for more than 10 days without any relief you should consult a physician. Although after occurrence of mumps once the person becomes immune for lifetime and relapse can be with very mild symptoms. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards."}

In aspiration cytology, cells are aspirated using a fine needle, spread on a glass slide and stained with appropriate stains. On the basis of test result, the type of lesion is determined and thus management can be planned. Consult your primary health care provider for clinical assessment and investigations.

Kidney infection is an upper urinary tract infection which usually occurs from a blood spread on body infection or spread from lower urinary tract due to obstruction in tract or urinary reflux. I will advise get your urinalysis done and get an ultrasound done if not done previous to find if any cause of stone/reflux. If diagnosed a urinary infection proper course of antibiotics like ciprofloxacin for 5 to 7 days is needed to treat completely. You can have lower urinary infection from sex if not proper hygiene is maintained. Always pass urine after sex to avoid this. Hope this helped, contact back for future query. Takecare!"}

However, in general the main indication for a hip replacement is pain arising from the hip or a fracture around the hip. Some patients do come in with horrible X-rays but do not have much pain, as is in your case. My opinion is that these patients would less benefit of going through surgery as they would not experience much pain relief compared to those who are in significant pain. My advice would be to start flexibility exercises to help stretch the muscles and improve your stiffness. Should your pain continue to worsen, and you find that you have difficulty in performing your daily activities then surgery is always an option."}

However, sometimes prolonged standing, excessive heat (warm weather), increased stress or anxiety, prolonged fasting, increased alcohol intake can also cause such problems.

Also, after removal of thyroid cancer, it is routine to get thyroid scans done to ensure that there is no cancer remaining in the body. Since you have not mentioned any such thing, probably it has not been done. If no scans have been done, then it is possible that your brother is suffering from a recurrence of his cancer which I would say is good news since it can be treated with medicines. So, I suggest you get a thyroid scan done on your brother. If it shows disease in the brain, then that explains everything and the cancer can be ablated with tablets (radio iodine).

First you have to understand that osteoarthritis mainly arises due to normal degenerative processes that occur with ones aging. So the best way to reduce inflammation and pain is to reduce the factors that cause them. The most important aspect of the treatment that I prescribe to my patients is physiotherapy. Not only does it strengthen the qua Chat Doctor. Secondly if the muscles are strengthened the surface of the bones that rub against each other and cause pain in osteoarthritis are less prone to do so and the further rate of degeneration comes down. Analgesics can help control acute flares. But like you, I prefer less of allopathic treatment for osteoarthritis and more of exercises. With their muscles becoming stronger they become more confident of ambulating around the house as well. I am not very certain of the extent natural remedies and alternative medicines can help. And rest assured that inflammation arising in osteoarthritis is least likely to affect the heart and brain. There is no correlation. Some lifestyle changes like avoiding too much of climbing stairs or squatting can be avoided."}

Since you mentioned you had a direct impact onto the knee and your shin and foot are sore, you need to first rule out if any old fracture is present or any bony misalignment. This can be ruled out by a CT/MRI/X-ray.you said you exercised a lot, but what exercises you performed is important. You even had a fall on a concrete, So the impact will be big enough. As bone is a hard tissue and muscle is a soft tissue, the impact will be varied by landing on the muscle and different from landing on the bone. Once your X-ray/CT/MRI shows all fine you can look ahead to next step or else you need to strictly follow the or tho guidelines. For time being I can only say to do hot water fermentation until you visit the doctor.Self-medication and self-healing is not advisable as specialist can help better.

The days he does PT, he can barely make it through the door. He had a follow up visit today and from what my husband told me they want to do an EKG next week to determine if surgery is needed.

Leg pain is due to nerve compression. Your doctor is trying to find if any nerve compression is there by EKG. My advice is it would be better if you do an MRI scan. This will give us clear picture that nerve compression is present or not. If your husband has more pain in leg than back, and nerve compression seen on MRI, he may be benefited with Surgery. Otherwise, he should focus on muscle strengthening and medicines. I hope this solved your query. Feel free to answer any other thing if you want. Take care."}

Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will help over coming this. Pain in neck 8-10 days post surgery is can be because of some infection inside or an infected stick. Local examination of the area will help in finding the cause. If it is so, antibiotics will help to resolve this. If this is long time since your surgery, muscular causes are usually the reason for pain in neck. Painkillers and muscle relaxants will help in solving the problem. Regards"}

Should I take him to emerg?", "output": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The lesion you notice is not a normally seen lesion and as you rightly figured he's not eating can be because of this problem. I suggest you to consult a pediatrician but surely it's not an emergency. The consultation is to confirm what the problem is and to decide on if any treatment required. As of now, I would suggest you to try to feed him as and when required and if child is breastfeeding, that can be tried which would help relieve part of his discomfort. Take care."}

I wish to inform you that there is no treatment in Ayurveda that can treat blockages in the heart arteries. Your brother is young and has blockages involving all the three arteries of the heart (triple vessel disease). He is prone to cardiac complications if surgery is not done. Any cardiac episode like a heart attack can decrease his heart pumping function and will considerably affect his quality of life. Please do not waste time looking for alternative Ayurveda treatment because it is simply not going to help. I have seen patients do very well after bypass surgery. Open-heart surgery is very well tolerated by patients, and they usually have a good quality of life. A bypass graft remains patent for 15-20 years. I have also seen patients who were reluctant to undergo a bypass surgery when it was the right time and later suffer. My opinion is to go ahead firmly with the decision of a bypass surgery.

Laying or sittjng still causes more shooting pain. I am looking to see if there is something I can do naturally to help me sleep and to lessen the pain. Thank you.", "output": "Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. In my opinion you may add some muscle relaxants and steroid intramuscular injections and some anticonvulsant that helps you sleep easier with lesser pain attacks. Neck exercises like extension, retraction, shoulder retraction, and isometric hold are highly suggestive in such cases. You may ask your neurosurgeon for further evaluation to recommend you the required dosing according to your condition. Sometimes a surgical solution is better especially after 6 months of treatment by physiotherapy and medications. Spinal surgeons can remove just the protruding portion of the disk. Rarely, however, the entire disk must be removed. In these cases, the vertebrae may need to be fused together with metal hardware to provide spinal stability. Rarely, your surgeon may suggest the implantation of an artificial disk. Please click on THANK YOU and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful.

I returned again at 9 weeks and he say s the bracket is all twisted, the screws are coming out, and the bone is not healing.

Thank you, Chris", "output": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As per your history I agree with the surgeon, that the healing has not occurred and might require another surgery. This is the commonest thing which occurs in foot injuries. Also, the bone healing is totally individual physiology induced, so a surgeon will not be able to do much except to regain the alignment of the bone by which there will be a normal physiological healing. If the healing doesn't occur there might be a need bone graft by which healing occurs. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor."}

Looking tiered and dull, with history of 2.5 kg weight loss over 1 month in a child is something that needs to be evaluated without delay. Sometimes this happens following febrile illnesses like typhoid or IMN (mononucleosis). If no such suggestive history, we need a basic workup to rule out conditions like anemia, chronic infection/inflammation or hematological disorders. If I were his treating doctor, after examining him for pallor and enlarged lymph nodes/spleen/liver, I will order few more tests including a blood count, ESR and peripheral smear. Kindly discuss with a pediatrician. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."}

Treatment, prognosis and life expectancy of any cancer is depended on its staging. And this goes true with esophageal malignancy. So to determine staging in his case following investigation s are needed.1. CT scan of neck to see for local extent of disease.2. PET scan to see for distal spread of disease. If distal spread is present then it is known as stage 4 cancer, and it carries poor prognosis. Life expectancy is less than 1 year. Only palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given. In the absence of distal spread surgical removal of esophagus with clear margin is the treatment of choice. Post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given to prevent local as well as distal spread. In these cases life expectancy is less than 5 years. Overall esophageal malignancy is not having good prognosis because of poor feeding issues after surgery."}

Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. The most probable cause of the pain on coughing in the belly button area is either a sprain in the muscles in this area, or tear or a hernia. This is best diagnosed by an examination done by a General Surgeon. Ultrasonography may or may not help unless the Radiologist knows what to see. Once a proper diagnosis has been made the treatment will be according to the exact problem. If sprain or so, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory medicines, complete bed-rest and of course the most important is the control of the cough. Take products with codeine which needs a prescription as this will control cough as well as the pain. Take laxatives to avoid strain at passing bowel movement. Hormonal changes at menopause have indirect effect as the psychological overlay causes more pains, stress, anxiety adding to the already existing problems. The lovely old lady syn Chat Doctor."}

Also how much of a difference would a treatment that can deliver the medicine directly to the cell make to your patients?", "output": "Hi there, Traditional cancer medicines are harmful in many ways. They cause delay in people seeking modern treatment. Even if one starts on treatment, they may stop it believing in traditional treatment methods etc. Once the cancer progresses beyond any cure and patients suffer in pain etc., they return to hospitals and then It's too late for modern medicine to offer anything but pain relief and palliative care. The traditional cancer doctors are usually very nice talkers and give plenty of time and listen to patients and more or less play with vulnerable patients emotions and then once they fail they put the blame back on the patients for not doing things exactly according to their instructions etc.... Also people are cheated financially in the process. Any person advertising alternative or traditional methods and claiming cure should be prosecuted. Why people don't go for traditional medicine when they meet a traffic accident or heart attack?? Why only for cancer???? Have you thought about it? Regards"}

What should I do to increase my chances of getting pregnant?", "output": "Hello, thank you for posting your query to Chat Doctor. Have you been continuously trying since past ten moths or did u give breaks in between? If you tried continuously since all these months, then I'd suggest you to get your scan done for POD, ovarian and uterine physiology along with a detailed checkup for thyroid and other hormones, And blood tests. Your husband also needs to be investigated in details at the same time. You could come back with all the reports to us, or you can see a doctor, with those reports. Meanwhile, do not lose hope and keep trying, as there is no hard and fast rule for the ratio of success rate to the no. of attempts in this matter. Some couples are first time lucky, and many others take much longer to get that positive on their pregnancy test. Also, don't stress over it, as it hampers one's chances of conceiving. Both you and your husband must follow a healthy lifestyle, that includes a combination of healthy mind, body and soul (exercises, healthy diet and peace of mind).

He went to the emergency room and they took an x-ray and basically rushed him out of the door due to his lack of insurance. His symptoms are extreme pain, with no bruising or swelling. It hurts when he lays down and even when he swallows. He was prescribed Ibuprofin 800 as well as a muscle relaxer but the pain does not let up. Is there anything else he can do?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your friends situation and problem. He is having chest pain on swallowing and lying down, and not improving with painkiller (ibuprofen) so possibility of HERD related pain is more. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Lying down position makes reflux easier. So better to keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Ask him to avoid painkiller Chat Doctor. Start proton pump inhibitors (antacid). Ask him to avoid stress and tension, avoid hot and spicy food, avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Ask him to quit smoking and alcohol if he has these habits. He will mostly improve with all these. If not improving than consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) copy. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks."}

Bad breath also supports this theory. Stomach upsets result in oral ulcers and as she was also suffering from fever, which maybe due to the oral infection, I would strongly recommend you to visit your dentist as well as physician. Once the teeth are clean and all the germs are eradicated she will be able to eat better and the bleeding along with swelling from gums will get eliminated.

I was thinking it was because I smothered it with a&d ointment the first few days? Please help me its not getting any better with lotion or hydrcortizone cream. What should I do?", "output": "Hi, thanks for your query. You seem to have developed contact irritant dermatitis to the ink used in tattooing. There may be no initial reaction, repeated contact with chemicals in the dye used for the tattoo can cause eventual sensitization and reaction to the product. So this did not happen with prior tattoos. Take oral anti histamine for a few days to control itching. Apply antibiotic and steroid combination cream twice a day for a week to 10 days. It may take 2-3 weeks to settle. Hope this helps you. Wish you a speedy recovery"}
{"instruction": "Explain the reasoning behind the healthcare response.", "input": "Hello there - my 5 year old daughter has a grey/blue/black mark about 4mm wide and long directly underneath her bottom front tooth (this is an adult tooth that came through about 6 months ago) and the gum looks lower than the tooth next to it... Have a dentist appointment booked for next Thursday but I m a bit worried... what could it be? she is fit and healthy but possibly doesn t have the best oral hygiene but we re trying.... thanks", "output": "Hello and welcome, the black/blue mark may be due to dental carries. Visit your dentist and get it checked. The carries can be excavated and filled with vitapex-gic or any other tooth colored material. As the tooth is erupted recently, gums look ugly as the adjacent teeth are yet to erupt, which is known as ugly duckling stage. The gums looks regular and proper tooth alignment occurs only after eruption all anterior teeth. Oral hygiene maintenance is very important. Poor oral hygiene will result in plaque and food debris accumulation. This results in gingivitis. Get the scaling done by your dentist. Use soft-bristled toothbrush to clean your teeth twice daily. Wash your mouth after every meal.always brush your teeth from up to down in upper arch and down to up in lower arch. Use chlorhaxidine containing mouthwash to prevent plaque accumulation.

The pain radiates into my ribs and down into my hip. I have scoliosis which was detected recently. Did not have it as a child or at all until now. My rib is protruding and obvious to the sight. I had a rotator cuff surgery two years ago which included a major surgery with five anchors. My tail bone hurts now from a fall I took a month ago. The x-ray showed in my spine at that time of the fall that I had two compression fractures that were old. I did not know I had them. I can t sleep and the pain is horrible .", "output": "Your lower back pain could be related to the compression fractures or from local inflammation that developed late. There are a few options for managing this pain1. I would recommend a repeat X-ray of the spine to exclude any changes in the bones since the original fall (since the last X-ray was one month back its possible things have changed since then)2. Physical therapy is often very helpful and can be tried3. In terms of medications, you could try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24-hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti-inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux. Since the X-ray will need to be ordered and interpreted by a physician, I recommend you see your primary care doctor too."}

The pathologists report", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a challenging diagnosis and the course of disease is directed by treatment. With stage 3A stomach cancer about a third of people (38%) live at least 5 years. With stage 3B about 1 in 6 people (15%) live for more than 5 years. Survival for 5 years after first detection of cancer is a milestone and with the best treatments patients can survive 5 years or more with stage 3 stomach cancer.However, the staging has changed after 17 of 20 lymph nodes show metastasis, and presently it is in stage 4. Unfortunately, about 8 out of 10 (80%) people diagnosed with stomach cancer are stage four, meaning the cancer has already spread when they are diagnosed and this is the case with your father-in-law. Therefore, the survival statistics are lower than for stage 3 stomach cancers. Fewer than 1 in 20 people (5%) live for at least 5 years if they have stage 4 stomach cancer when they are diagnosed."}

You had put it in 2011. So its life has ended in 2013. It is not good to keep it in the body after it is no more active. When we say it is not active, we mean that the hormones released from the implant are not in sufficient quantity to prevent the pregnancy; however, it is not completely devoid of the hormones. The very fact that you have started having irregular bleeding, the implant is releasing the hormone erratically in low doses. You should get the implant removed and replace it with another one if you still want to continue with the contraception. With such extinct implant, you cannot plan your pregnancy appropriately either. I hope you got the message."}

In my opinion the sore breasts, frequent urination can be symptoms of pregnancy. But it needs to be confirmed by doing a urine pregnancy test.

Other symptoms of pregnancy are nausea, vomiting, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period. I suggest you to do a urine pregnancy test to check for the pregnancy. The urine pregnancy test can be done at home by urine pregnancy strip method. Hope this helps. Best regards..."}

The fact is that Strategy (Atomoxetine) was prescribed for your sons ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder). You state that your son is also taking Synthroid (Levothyroxine), which a replacement for a natural hormone (chemical) that occurs in the body. I will directly answer you question by saying that Prozac (Fluoxetine) when given with Strategy, causes problems in blood pressure and heart rate. This is dependent on the exact dose of Prozac that is given and your sons weight. If you wished to continue Prozac therapy, then you would definitely have to go to a Doctor who would precisely calculate the right dose of Prozac for your son.

Now on the important issue of beta blocker, you tend to get bradycardia with ten 50\\u00a0mg in a day, as you are on so many years on beta blocker, and we want to medically manage HD, we should optimize the dose. Do try replacement of atenolol with Weibull, which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, so bradycardia is less than compared to ten. Take blood pressure at different times of the day, and dose the antihypertensive accordingly to minimize peaks and troughs.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related symptoms because your symptoms worsen after eating. But better to rule out heart diseases first because you are having left sided chest pain. So get done ECG and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. HERD is more likely in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

After going through your query I came to know that you are suffering from post dramatic chronic backache after L1 burst.

Both these days fall in safe period. The egg release takes place 14 days prior to next expected period. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of about one week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile period. The chances of pregnancy are very high if the intercourse is performed in this period. Your both sessions of intercourses were far away from this period. So there is no chance that you are pregnant. Moreover, you already have started having spotting. So you will get menses in few days.

It's a natural part of the process, the taste will go away eventually. Definitely keep up with the salt water rinses and the antiseptic mouthwashes. Do Floss. Floss well in the backs of those molars next to where your wisdom teeth used to be. You'd be surprised at the amount of plaque that can build there, and bacteria from your healing mouth can gather there and hold that bad taste. Hope this will help you. Warm regards"}

{"instruction": "Explain the reasoning behind the healthcare response.", "input": "Hi I was wondering, with a PET scan, should you be able to tell the difference between active scar tissue, and scar tissue from radiation treatment (which ended approx.7 weeks ago)? Also if a PET scan shows inflammation in the lymph nodes, but the lymph nodes appear normal how likely might it be that the inflammation is residual effects from the radiation,or rather that the cancer returned?", "output": "Hi, PET scan will certainly be able to differentiate between scar tissue and cancer. But the timing of PET scan is very, very important. After radiation therapy, it is ideal to wait for 12 weeks before radiation induced inflammation becomes normal. If FDG uptake occurs after 12 weeks from completion of radiation, it is not radiation induced inflammation. At 7 weeks, it becomes difficult to conclusively say if its cancer or radiation induced inflammation. But the dictum if radiation induced FDG uptake is usually diffuse and low to moderate grade. A focal area of uptake usually indicates another problem like cancer or infection. Recurrent cancer is usually focal and intense, though it's not a dictum in all the cases."}

How do you explain this difference? What do these genes code for normally? In a healthy person, what role are the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes playing, and how do they do it?", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, I will explain to you briefly the difference between tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.

Oncogene is responsible for particular malignancy. The role of proto-oncogene in health is to keep a check on uncontrolled growth of cells. Tumor suppressor genes are encoded by two alleles. Mutation of both these alleles is required for development of malignancy. Tumor suppressor genes in health also prevent development of malignancy. Mutation of these genes may be genetic or is caused by chemicals, physical damage like radiations, etc. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor."}

What exactly is this and what could it mean? Thank you. IMPRESSION", "output": "Hi thanks for asking question. If you have no symptoms at all then it has of less value. But here are few possibilities.1. First interstitial pulmonary edema can lead to such prominent marking. Patient will also complain pink frothy sputum and dyspnea.2. Second if you are working in textile industry or asbestos using industry then chances of pneumoconiosis is present like silicosis, asbestos is etc. Can lead to dyspnea with such x-ray finding.3. If you have dyspnea, cough, fever, chest pain then interstitial pneumonia like atypical viral or cytoplasm pneumonia can be the cause.4. If you have increasing breathlessness and no specific cause found for that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has to be ruled out. To distinguish between restrictive and obstructive disease pulmonary function test is useful. Complete blood examination also helpful. I hope my suggestion will help you."}

You can also do deep breathing exercises for relaxation. If that is not helping then a short course of anxiolytic like alprazolam or beta blockers like metoprolol in small dose will be helpful.

Having a small cavity would not indicate a need for an antibiotic. If you are experiencing discomfort and any signs of inflammation around the tooth, discuss with your dentist the need to take pre-operative medication. Your dentist may recommend an anti-inflammatory medication to start shortly before the planned extraction. Antibiotics are not absolutely necessary prior to an extraction. It is important not to overuse antibiotics. Resistance to antibiotics are a risk. Blindness is generally not a risk with an extraction. Complications from an extraction, infection with the spread of inflammation, and an unusual nerve anatomy may result in some possible conditions that may involve eye function. Paresthesia is a risk associated with injections and possible with extractions. This would be numbness remaining instead of wearing off as normally expected. Often with time this will diminish unless there is a dual nerve damage. Preoperative x-rays are taken to evaluate root proximity to nerves. You should review all possible complications and your medical history impact with your dentist prior to the extraction. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you feel better about having your extraction and that my comments have been helpful to you."}

So, you need to take antibiotics in labor through the intravenous route to prevent the transmission of these bacteria to your baby. The usual antibiotic given is penicillin, but if you are allergies an alternative is given. It would be advisable to take antibiotic for the strep b infection now also, and you could consider taking it with a local antifungal cream for the thrush, especially if you have grouped B strep in your urine culture. Do remember to repeat strep b culture at 36 weeks, and please inform your obstetrician that you have had this infection during this pregnancy, to make sure you get intrapartum antibiotics to prevent transmission of bacteria to your baby.

Night fall (nocturnal ejaculation) is not due to excess masturbation. In fact, masturbation controls night fall. You should understand the process.

If you masturbate or engage in sex, the waste goes out. Otherwise, body finds its own way to expel the waste and the ways are through nocturnal ejaculation or through urine. Dark circles near eyes, loosening of cheeks etc. are due to stress.

Im currently not taking any medication and the pain started Saturday night. It has progressed. Even while resting i have discomfort.", "output": "Hello, johnpaf7,I see that you are a weight lifter, which is good. The symptoms that you describe are suggestive offer (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Thesesymtoms may be associated with a hiatus hernia. If a part of your stomach slides up and down through the hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen, that is hiatal hernia. This can get aggravated by heavy lifting, bending, coughing etc. What happens is, there is a sphincter barrier at the junction of the esophagus and stomach that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. If the sphincter is weak, then acid can back up and cause pain, heartburn etc. If you are experiencing pain when you eat, Chat Doctor. You might even have some scarring from acid damage and spasm or narrowing. What you need is to get an x-ray of the esophagus and stomach first to look for any narrowing or big hiatus hernia. If present, then you need an endoscopic evaluation by a specialist to get a direct look and perhaps biopsy to look for problems. As for the history of gallbladder disease in the family, you can get sonogram of the gallbladder as a screening test. There are effective medications to treat HERD which you can discuss with your doctor after the tests I mentioned above. I wish you good luck and good health."}

{"instruction": "Answer the healthcare question clearly.", "input": "I am now having severe right buttocks pain, which has gotten worse after two cortisone shots, physical therapy for 11 sessions and an xray was taken in the begginning. Do you think my next step will be an MRI to determine what the pain is coming from?", "output": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history. As the history suggest that this is more of a lumbar spine disc degenerative disease. As due to nerve root impingement in the lumbar spine the sciatic notch in the gluteal region will have a severe pain and needs a thorough clinical examination and an MRI to understand the pathology of the lumbar spine. Infact with 11 sessions of physical therapy the pain can not come down and may need more sessions as well. Taking therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help control the pain symptomatically and exercises will play an important role in stabilizing the spine and also improving the muscle strength to hold the spine without leading to nerve root impingement. In my clinical practice most patients need more than 15 sessions of physical therapy, and they respond well. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor."}

But if the pain is not very severe, and you do not have fever / nausea / vomiting, it is less likely to be appendicitis. Besides the CAT scan was also normal ruling out any chances of appendicitis.

Adequate rest and analgesics like Motrin would be helpful in these conditions to relieve your pain. In addition, Chat Doctor. I understand you are concerned.

The contraceptive implant is actually one of the most effective birth control methods available, and has a lower failure rate than even sterilization. Unfortunately, it is also very common to have irregular bleeding, mood changes, food cravings, and weight gain as a side effect of the hormones in the implant. So just in case, I would perform a urine pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant, however the most likely explanation for your symptoms is general side effects from the hormones in the implant. Most people eventually stop menstruating completely with the implant and have minimal hormonal changes, but this may take 6 to 9 months to develop.

Could my low blood pressure have anything to do with this? should I try to raise it for more circulation in my uterus daily?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.
